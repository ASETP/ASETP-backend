76809698,Spring security method cannot decide pattern is MVC or not Spring Boot application exception,76919712,"<p>A migration occurred due to vulnerability <a href=""https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035"" rel=""noreferrer"">CVE-2023-34035</a>.</p>
<p>In the event that you get an error like the following:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You should use <strong>a complete RequestMatcher</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if an application has a servlet deployed to /my-servlet/* and is authorizing that traffic like so:</p>
<pre><code>@Bean
SecurityFilterChain appSecurity(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -&gt; authorize

<p>then, the application should instead do the following:</p>
<pre><code>import static org.springframework.security.web.util.matcher.AntPathRequestMatcher.antMatcher;

@Bean
MvcRequestMatcher.Builder mvc(HandlerMappingIntrospector introspector) {
    return new MvcRequestMatcher.Builder(introspector);

76809698,Spring security method cannot decide pattern is MVC or not Spring Boot application exception,76825159,"<p>For now there are two options recommended by <a href=""https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035</a></p>
<p><strong>First Option:</strong><br />
Did a small very simple poc war web application in tomcat.
Debugged  this method -</p>
<p>org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.AbstractRequestMatcherRegistry.requestMatchers(HttpMethod method, String... patterns)</p>
<p>Studied <a href=""https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035</a></p>
<p>Just before the below lines in above mentioned method I examined what was in the registrations object.</p>
<p>Assert.isTrue(registrations.size() == 1, &quot;This method cannot decide whether these patterns are Spring MVC patterns or not. If this endpoint is a Spring MVC endpoint, please use requestMatchers(MvcRequestMatcher); otherwise, please use requestMatchers(AntPathRequestMatcher).&quot;);</p>
<p>Found it to be registrations of</p>
<pre><code>org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet against &quot;default&quot;
org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet against &quot;jsp&quot;
org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet against &quot;dispatcher&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In <a href=""https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035</a> they mention
&quot;Sometimes these extra servlets are not needed. For example, some servlet containers will add a DefaultServlet that DispatcherServlet effectively replaces. In many cases, such a servlet can be removed from your container's global configuration&quot;.</p>
<p>What they are saying is that we should edit apache-tomcat-10.1.10\conf\web.xml.</p>
<p>We should comment out the registrations in that web.xml for org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet,
org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.
We should also remove the mapping entries in same web.xml</p>
<p>For other servlet containers we can consider similar concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Second Option:</strong><br />
The other option is to do what they also suggested in &quot;For an example mitigation, please see the following Spring Security sample application and the corresponding diff.&quot; <a href=""https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035</a> namely follow <a href=""https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-samples/commit/4e3bec904a5467db28ea33e25ac9d90524b53d66"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-samples/commit/4e3bec904a5467db28ea33e25ac9d90524b53d66</a></p>
<p>In other words the example they give is
Replace :</p>
<pre><code>    .requestMatchers(&quot;/login&quot;, &quot;/resources/**&quot;).permitAll()   
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code>    .requestMatchers(mvc.pattern(&quot;/login&quot;),
         mvc.pattern(&quot;/resources/**&quot;)).permitAll()  
</code></pre>
<p>In a web application you would usually use mvc matcher as shown here.
You can also use ant matcher - there is a little risk in using ant matchers as explained here- <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50536292/difference-between-antmatcher-and-mvcmatcher"">Difference between antMatcher and mvcMatcher</a> . <strong>Using ant matcher is best avoided unless you are willing to do necessary testing if you start using it.</strong> In complex scenarios can use regexmatchers also - use it only if needed (not in this scenario where you just want to solve this current issue).</p>
<p>Regarding how to achieve mvc.pattern() itself here are the steps.  Declare a bean as below somewhere.</p>
<pre><code>@Bean
    MvcRequestMatcher.Builder mvc(HandlerMappingIntrospector introspector) {
        return new MvcRequestMatcher.Builder(introspector);
    } 
</code></pre>
<p>In your security configurations just autowire it like so:</p>
<pre><code>@Autowired
    MvcRequestMatcher.Builder mvc;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Decision Point:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to retain original code try editing the server's (not project's) web.xml-or similar configuration if not tomcat - but some other servlet container , to eliminate the extra servlets that come by default in servlet containers.<br />
If you are willing to change code try the second option.</p>
<p><em>Also Note:</em></p>
<p>Sometimes if its legacy code and you are using DispatcherServlet methods in your code you will have to eliminate that to use first option or else settle for second option.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p><strong>Adding more new information</strong>:</p>
<p>In fact if you further migrate from spring-boot-starter-parent:3.1.2 to spring-boot-starter-parent:3.1.3 the messages are even clearer.
It says the problem:
there is more than one mappable servlet in your servlet context: {org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet=[*.jspx, *.jsp], org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet=[/]}.</p>
<p>And that is why following <a href=""https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34035</a> one option is to just disable the default and jsp related servlets. Useful if you dont want to change code but are fine with changing server configuration.</p>
<p>The second option if you go the code change route was always clearly logged.
&quot;For each MvcRequestMatcher, call MvcRequestMatcher#setServletPath to indicate the servlet path.&quot; Only as &quot;otherwise&quot; they mention AntMatchers</p>
<p>I will repeat avoid AntMatcher because of its dangers when using web applications for this migration purpose if you go for second option.</p>

18173222,Difference between Catch(Exception) and Catch(Exception ex),18174025,"<p>Well, <code>catch(Exception ex)</code> is just the same as <code>catch(Exception)</code> with one difference
only: in <code>catch(Exception ex)</code> we have an access to the exception class (error cause)
instance. Usually you need an exception class instance to print out the original
message:</p>
<pre><code>  try {
    ...
  }
  catch (AppServerException e) {
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Application server failed to get data with the message:&quot;);
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message); // &lt;- What's actually got wrong with it
  }
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't need the exception class instance, e.g. you plan just to consume the
exception, the catch(Exception ex) syntax is excessive and catch(Exception) is
prefferable:</p>
<pre><code>  try {  
    c = a / b;
  }  
  catch (DivideByZeroException) {
    c = Int.MaxValue; // &lt;- in case b = 0, let c be the maximum possible int
  }

    int c = a / b;

<p>There are situations when the <code>catch</code> block needs to do more than simply show exception's message. For example, when you catch application-specific exceptions, you may be able to examine additional elements of the exception object. Here is a hypothetical example:</p>

<pre><code>catch (ConnectToServerException cse) {
    MessageBox.Show(string.Format(
        ""Connection to server '{0}' failed. Use a name from the following list: {1}""
    ,   cse.AttemptedConnectionServerName
    ,   string.Join("", "", cse.AllowedServerNames)
    ));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code assumes that the custom exception <code>ConnectToServerException</code> has a property called <code>AttemptedConnectionServerName</code> with the name of the server to which you tried to connect, and an enumeration property <code>AllowedServerNames</code> with the names of available servers.</p>

<p>There are also situations when all you need to know is that an exception of a particular type just happened. In this case, you do not need to provide a named variable for it.</p>

  <p>However how too diagnose the cause of the exception after catching it?</p>

<p>You cannot. The stack has already been unwound at the point of the catch. If you want to diagnose reasons for a throw you'll need to include them in the exception at the point of the throw (this could include a full stack trace if you were so inclined, but that would be system-dependent).</p>

<p>Other things you might want to consider:</p>

<p>a) add more precondition checks at the call sites of API calls (where you can't modify the code in the call)</p>

<p>b) add precondition checks (asserts or throws) in functions and methods that you control. You can remove them in a release build if performance is an issue.</p>

<p>c) include the full reason for the throw in the message of thrown exceptions. </p>

40962619,Stack trace after catching exception,56309991,"<p>If you are working with your own exceptions, then my <a href=""https://github.com/m2osw/libexcept"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libexcept</a> library may be useful to you. This library offers a few class. The base class is capable of collecting a stack trace at the time it gets instantiated. 99% of the time, this gives you all the information you need to debug the issue. When you just know where the exception occurred, but not how it was called, it can be much more difficult to kow how to fix the problem. (Yeah! Because the same function may be called in 20 different ways so just knowing exactly which exception occurred is often not enough.)</p>

<p>In a project where you throw exceptions only when something <em>really bad</em> happens, this can even be kept in your release version. Then you can log the stack traces in your client's logs and make it hundred of times easier to debug remote/end client <em>crashes</em>.</p>

<p>I have a <a href=""https://launchpad.net/~snapcpp/+archive/ubuntu/ppa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">binary (pre-compiled version) for Ubuntu 16.04 on Launchpad</a> (install the PPA in your apt lists and then install <code>libexcept_1.0.5.0~xenial_amd64.deb</code> or whatever version is current.)</p>

<p>To use, derive from one of the two classes offered:</p>

<pre><code>class my_exception : public libexcept::logic_exception_t
{
   ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>And in your <code>catch()</code> you can print the stack trace using the <code>get_stack_trace()</code> to get a vector of strings. In our case, we actually send that to our logs.</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    ...
    throw my_exception(""what happened?!"");
    ...
}
catch(my_exception const &amp; e)
{
    stack_trace_t const &amp; stack(e.get_stack_trace());
    for(auto s : stack)
    {
        SNAP_LOG_ERROR(*s);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, you probably will want to have a function if you are to log the stack trace in many places.</p>

<p>For exceptions that you do not generate, though, you just can't really do much. However, you can re-throw with your own exception if you want to write a wrapper so as to at least narrow the location where the exceptions are coming from.</p>

<p>Say you are using a 3rd party <code>library</code> and expect <code>library</code> to throw once in a while...</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    library::func();   // may throw
}
catch(library::exception const &amp; e)
{
    throw my_exception(e.what());   // converted exception
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you at least have a stack trace from this low level catch.</p>

<p>I agree with @Alberto Morillo, your exception should be ""Unable to process a schema with 2434 tables, 500 is the max...."".</p>

<p>Here's the Azure official blog talk about how to <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/es-mx/blog/sync-sql-data-in-large-scale-using-azure-sql-data-sync/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sync SQL data in large scale using Azure SQL Data Sync</a>. It gives you a solution to solve the exception:</p>

<p><strong>Sync data between databases with many tables</strong></p>

<p>Currently, data sync can only sync between databases with less than 500 tables. You can work around this limitation by creating multiple sync groups using different database users. For example, you want to sync two databases with 900 tables. First, you need to define two different users in the database where you load the sync schema from. Each user can only see 450 (or any number less than 500) tables in the database. Sync setup requires ALTER DATABASE permission which implies CONTROL permission over all tables so you will need to explicitly DENY the permissions on tables which you don’t want a specific user to see, instead of using GRANT. You can find the exact privilege needed for sync initialization in the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-best-practices-data-sync"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">best practice guidance</a>. Then you can create two sync groups, one for each user. Each sync group will sync 450 tables between these two databases. Since each user can only see less than 500 tables, you will be able to load the schema and create sync groups! After the sync group is created and initialized, we recommend you follow the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-best-practices-data-sync"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">best practice guidance</a> to update the user permission and make sure they have the minimum privilege for ongoing sync.</p>

<p>It is a current limitation on SQL Data Sync that if the database has more than 500 tables, it does not get the schema for you to select the tables - even if you want to select and sync only 1 table. </p>

<p>A workaround for you is to delete the extra tables or move the un-needed tables into another DB. Not ideal, we agree, but is a workaround for now. To try the workaround perform the following steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Script the tables you want to sync(less than 500 tables per synchronization group)</li>
<li>Create a new temporary database and run the script to create the tables you want to sync</li>
<li>Register and add the new temporary database as a member of the sync group </li>
<li>Use the new temporary database to pick the tables you want to sync</li>

16244923,How to make a custom exception class with multiple init args pickleable,36342588,"<p>The current answers break down if you're using both arguments to construct an error message to pass to the parent Exception class. I believe the best way is to simply override the <code>__reduce__</code> method in your exception. The <code>__reduce__</code> method should return a two item tuple. The first item in the tuple is your class. The second item is a tuple containing the arguments to pass to your class's <code>__init__</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>import pickle

class MyException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        self.arg1 = arg1
        self.arg2 = arg2

        super(MyException, self).__init__('arg1: {}, arg2: {}'.format(arg1, arg2))

    def __reduce__(self):
        return (MyException, (self.arg1, self.arg2))


original = MyException('foo', 'bar')
print repr(original)
print original.arg1
print original.arg2

reconstituted = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(original))
print repr(reconstituted)
print reconstituted.arg1
print reconstituted.arg2

</code></pre>

<p>The base <code>Exception</code> class defines a <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#object.__reduce__"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>.__reduce__()</code> method</a> to make the extension (C-based) type picklable and that method only expects <em>one</em> argument (which is <code>.args</code>); see the <a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Objects/exceptions.c#l182"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>BaseException_reduce()</code> function in the C source</a>.</p>

<p>The easiest work-around is making extra arguments optional. The <code>__reduce__</code> method <em>also</em> includes any additional object attributes beyond <code>.args</code> and <code>.message</code> and your instances are recreated properly:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; e = MyException('foo', 'bar')
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.__reduce__()
(&lt;class '__main__.MyException'&gt;, ('foo',), {'arg1': 'foo', 'arg2': 'bar'})

MyException('foo',)

16244923,How to make a custom exception class with multiple init args pickleable,27334007,"<p>I like Martijn's answer, but I think a better way is to pass all arguments to the <code>Exception</code> base class:</p>

42947613,How to resolve Unneccessary Stubbing exception,49512038,"<p>At first you should check your test logic. Usually there are 3 cases. First, you are mocking the wrong method (you made a typo or someone changed tested code so that mocked method is no longer used). Second, your test is failing before this method is called. Third, your logic falls in wrong if/switch branch somewhere in the code so that mocked method is not called.</p>
<p>If this is the first case you always want to change the mocked method for the one used in the code. With the second and the third it depends. Usually you should just delete this mock if it has no use. But sometimes there are certain cases in parametrized tests, which should take this different path or fail earlier. Then you can split this test into two or more separate ones but that's not always good looking. 3 test methods with possibly 3 arguments providers can make your test look unreadable. In that case for JUnit 4 you silent this exception with either</p>
<pre><code>@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.Silent.class)

<pre class=""lang-groovy prettyprint-override""><code>testImplementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-test:1.6.0'

    override fun starting(description: Description?) = Dispatchers.setMain(dispatcher)

<p>And then add the rule to your test class:</p>
<pre><code>@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi

<p>The user in the dpage/pgadmin4 container does not have permission to read and write in the specified directory, in this case the pgadmin folder you mapped to the image volume.</p>
<p>By defaut, the pgadmin image has the user <em>pgadmin user (UID: 5050) in the pgadmin group (GID: 5050)</em> and that user cant read and write in the host, your machine. To make it possible yo just have to run the following:</p>

<p>Run the docker compose as it is, then navigate to the folder it has created, make sure you are inside, the one that map to the volume, your case: pgadmin</p>

SEH-exceptions are very annoying because they do not cause normal stack unwinding which can lead to unclosed files or not-unlocked mutexes that should normally cleared by the destructors of the owning object.
I have encountered SEH-exceptions when accessing memory that does not belong to the current process so I recommend looking at memory-related instructions in the constructor and destructor of CSig.

<p>I have been receiving a lot of comments on how it does not persist data b/w sessions. What you can do to fix that is put it in a try and catch statement. In try, call <code>sharedPreferences.get</code> and catch the error and then do setMockInitialValues. If <code>sharedPreferences.get</code> does not give an error, it means there is already data and no need to set mock values replacing the old ones.</p>

        # (we cannot do an assignment since tuples are immutable)
        # If you inherit from the exception that takes message as a keyword
        # maybe you will need to check kwargs here

<p>An even more succinct but restricted solution, in a way that you can only raise the CustomException with no arguments is:</p>
<pre><code>class CustomException(Exception):
     def __init__(self):
         default_message = 'This is a default message!'
         super().__init__(default_message)
</code></pre>
<p>You can of course save one line, in each of the above solutions, if you just pass the string literal to the constructor rather than using the <code>default_message</code> variable.</p>
<p>If you want the code to be Python 2.7 compatible, then you just replace the: <code>super()</code> with <code>super(CustomException, self)</code>.</p>
<p>Now running:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; raise CustomException
</code></pre>
<p>will output:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
__main__.CustomException: This is a default message!
</code></pre>
<p>and running:</p>
<pre><code>raise CustomException('This is a custom message!')
</code></pre>
<p>will output:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
__main__.CustomException: This is a custom message!
</code></pre>
<p>This is the output that the first 2 solutions' code will produce. The last solution, differs in that calling it with at least one argument, like:</p>
<pre><code>raise CustomException('This is a custom message!')
</code></pre>
<p>it will output:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;

49224770,Default message in custom exception - Python,66491013,"<p>As regarded in an answer to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1319615/proper-way-to-declare-custom-exceptions-in-modern-python"">this question</a>, this is a pretty good way to declare a custom exception:</p>
<pre><code>class MyException(Exception):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Docstring here&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If one has many exceptions to define, one may use a subclass of <code>Exception</code> as their exceptions' superclass to make these exceptions' docstrings their default messages:</p>
<pre><code>class DocDefaultException(Exception):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Subclass exceptions use docstring as default message&quot;&quot;&quot;
    def __init__(self, msg=None, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(msg or self.__doc__, *args, **kwargs)

class MyException(DocDefaultException):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Docstring here.&quot;&quot;&quot;

raise MyException
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;C:\************************.py&quot;, line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    raise MyException
__main__.MyException: Docstring here
</code></pre>
<p>A decorator also works to use the docstring of a custom exception as its default message:</p>
<pre><code>import functools

def docstring_message(cls):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Decorates an exception to make its docstring its default message.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    # Must use cls_init name, not cls.__init__ itself, in closure to avoid recursion
    cls_init = cls.__init__ 
    @functools.wraps(cls.__init__)
    def wrapped_init(self, msg=cls.__doc__, *args, **kwargs):
        cls_init(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
    cls.__init__ = wrapped_init
    return cls

@docstring_message
class MyException(Exception):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Docstring here&quot;&quot;&quot;

raise MyException
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;C:\************************.py&quot;, line 16, in &lt;module&gt;
    raise MyException
__main__.MyException: Docstring here
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, one should raise exceptions with a descriptive message, but a default fallback is sufficient sometimes and a docstring can suffice if written correctly.</p>

<p>You also seem to have used your defined models, to be able to import them into your python script, you need to add the path to the root folder of your project to the current python path.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to tell django where your <strong>settings file</strong> is (<em>before</em> setting up your django), in your manage.py file, you should have something like this :</p>

<pre><code>os.environ.setdefault(""DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"", ""myapp.settings"")

<p>Go make it a constant, name it * DEFAULT_SETTINGS_MODULE *, so you now have:</p>

<pre><code>os.environ.setdefault(""DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"", DEFAULT_SETTINGS_MODULE)

<p>Now you need to import the constant into your script and tell django (By setting an env var) where it should look for the settings file. </p>

<p>So in all:</p>

<pre><code>import sys, os

<blockquote>
  <p>If no expressions are present, <code>raise</code> re-raises the last exception that
  was active in the current scope. If no exception is active in the
  current scope, a <code>TypeError</code> exception is raised indicating that this is
  an error (if running under IDLE, a <code>Queue.Empty</code> exception is raised
  instead).</p>
  
  <p>Otherwise, <code>raise</code> evaluates the expressions to get three objects, using
  <code>None</code> as the value of omitted expressions. The first two objects are
  used to determine the type and value of the exception.</p>
  
  <p>If a third object is present and not <code>None</code>, it must be a traceback
  object (see section The standard type hierarchy), and it is
  substituted instead of the current location as the place where the
  exception occurred. If the third object is present and not a traceback
  object or <code>None</code>, a <code>TypeError</code> exception is raised.</p>
  
  <p>The three-expression
  form of <code>raise</code> is useful to re-raise an exception transparently in an

<h2>Answer prior to 2022</h2>
<p>I'm not aware of a native method like Java's and I've not found an elegant solution for wrapping errors yet.</p>
<p>The problem with creating a <code>new Error</code> is you can lose metadata that was attached to the original <code>Error</code> that was thrown, the stack trace and type are generally the important items lost.</p>
<p>Making modifications to an existing thrown error is quicker, but it is still possible to modify data from the error out of existence. It also feels wrong to be poking around in an error that was created somewhere else.</p>
<br>
<h2>Create a new Error and new stack</h2>
<p>The <code>.stack</code> property of a new <code>Error</code> is a plain string and can be modified to say what you like before it is thrown. Replacing an errors <code>stack</code> property completely can get really confusing for debugging though.</p>
<p>When the original thrown error and the error handler are in separate locations or files (which is common with promises), you might be able to trace the source of the original error but not trace the handler where the error was actually trapped. To avoid this it's good to keep some references to both the original and new error in the <code>stack</code>. It's also useful to have access to the complete original error if there was additional metadata stored in it.</p>
<p>Here's an example of catching an error, wrapping it in a new error but adding the original <code>stack</code> and storing the <code>error</code>:</p>
<pre><code>try {
  throw new Error('First one')
} catch (error) {
  let e = new Error(`Rethrowing the &quot;${error.message}&quot; error`)
  e.original_error = error
  e.stack = e.stack.split('\n').slice(0,2).join('\n') + '\n' +
            error.stack
  throw e
}

<p>So we've created a new generic <code>Error</code>. Unfortunately the type of the original error becomes hidden from the output but the <code>error</code> has been attached as <code>.original_error</code> so it can still be accessed. The new <code>stack</code> has been largely removed except for the generating line which is important, and the original errors <code>stack</code> appended.</p>
<p>Any tools that try to parse stack traces might not work with this change or best case, they detect two errors.</p>
<h2>Rethrowing with ES2015+ Error Classes</h2>
<p>Making this into a reusable ES2015+ Error class:</p>
<pre><code>class RethrownError extends Error {
  constructor(message, error){
    super(message)
    this.name = this.constructor.name
    if (!error) throw new Error('RethrownError requires a message and error')
    this.original_error = error
    this.stack_before_rethrow = this.stack
    const message_lines =  (this.message.match(/\n/g)||[]).length + 1
    this.stack = this.stack.split('\n').slice(0, message_lines+1).join('\n') + '\n' +
                 error.stack
  }
}

throw new RethrownError(`Oh no a &quot;${error.message}&quot; error`, error)
</code></pre>
<p>Results in</p>
<pre><code>/so/42754270/test2.js:31
    throw new RethrownError(`Oh no a &quot;${error.message}&quot;&quot; error`, error)
    ^

<p>Then you know that whenever you see a <code>RethrownError</code> that the original error will still be available at <code>.original_error</code>.</p>
<p>This method is not perfect but it means I can re-type known errors from underlying modules into generic types that be handled more easily, usually with bluebirds <a href=""http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/catch.html#filtered-catch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">filtered catch <code>.catch(TypeError, handler)</code></a></p>
<p><em><em>Note</em></em> <code>stack</code> becomes enumerable here</p>
<h2>Same Error with a modified stack</h2>
<p>Some times you will need to keep the original error mostly as is.</p>
<p>In this case you can just append/insert the new info onto existing stack.</p>
<pre><code>file = '/home/jim/plumbers'
try {
   JSON.parse('k')
} catch (e) {
   let message = `JSON parse error in ${file}`
   let stack = new Error(message).stack
   e.stack = e.stack + '\nFrom previous ' + stack.split('\n').slice(0,2).join('\n') + '\n'
   throw e
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which returns</p>
<pre><code>/so/42754270/throw_error_replace_stack.js:13

<p>Also note that the stack processing is simple and assumes the error message is a single line. If you run into multi line error messages you might need to look for <code>\n    at </code> to terminate the message.</p>
"
42754270,Re-throwing exception in NodeJS and not losing stack trace,46324963,"<p>If all you want to do is change the message, you can just change the message:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">

}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>If the message property is readonly, you can create a new object using the original error as the prototype and assigning a new message:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>try {  // line 12

  let e = Object.create( err, { message: { value: message } } );
  throw e;  // line 17
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the logged message for an Exception is just &quot;Uncaught exception&quot; without the message that came with the Exception, so it might be helpful to create an Error and give it the same stack so the logged message will include the error message:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>try {  // line 12

  e = new Error( ""Here is some context -- "" + err.message );
  e.stack = err.stack;
  throw e;  // line 17
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Since the snippet output shows the line number of the re-throw, this confirms that the stack is preserved:</p>

It looks like this:</p>

16313227,How do I get the value and type of the current exception in C++ in gdb?,16324068,"<p><strong>Updated</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Here's some info from the GDB Manual</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are currently some limitations to C++ exception handling (catch
  throw and catch catch) in gdb:</p>
  
  <p>If you call a function interactively, gdb normally returns control to
  you when the function has finished executing. If the call raises an
  exception, however, the call may bypass the mechanism that returns
  control to you and cause your program either to abort or to simply
  continue running until it hits a breakpoint, catches a signal that gdb
  is listening for, or exits. This is the case even if you set a
  catchpoint for the exception; catchpoints on exceptions are disabled
  within interactive calls. You cannot raise an exception interactively.
  You cannot install an exception handler interactively. Sometimes catch
  is not the best way to debug exception handling: if you need to know
  exactly where an exception is raised, it is better to stop before the
  exception handler is called, since that way you can see the stack
  before any unwinding takes place. If you set a breakpoint in an
  exception handler instead, it may not be easy to find out where the
  exception was raised.</p>
  
  <p>To stop just before an exception handler is called, you need some
  knowledge of the implementation. In the case of gnu C++, exceptions
  are raised by calling a library function named __raise_exception which
  has the following ANSI C interface:</p>

<pre><code>     /* addr is where the exception identifier is stored.
        id is the exception identifier.  */
     void __raise_exception (void **addr, void *id); To make the debugger catch all exceptions before any stack unwinding takes place,
</code></pre>
  
  <p>set a breakpoint on __raise_exception (see Breakpoints; Watchpoints;
  and Exceptions).</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>That said</p>

<p>It depends on the code and where you are in the stack. If you actually caught the exception as in :  </p>

<pre><code>try { .... } catch (std::exception &amp;e) {
   //do stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could probably try printing <code>e.what()</code>, or look at the members of the exception.  If you just caught it as (...) then I'm not sure what you'd be able to gather.</p>

<p>Another handling thing you could do is to catch 'throw' in gdb and catch 'catch' as well if you really want to follow the whole flow.</p>

<pre><code>gdb&gt; catch catch  
gdb&gt; catch throw
</code></pre>

<p>This way you will get a breakpoints right before exceptions are thrown and right as they are caught, you could then walk the stack to gain more information about what was going on.  Even if you are in another  break point you should be able to walk up the stack (using up or down) to get the frame in which the exception is visible.</p>
"
16313227,How do I get the value and type of the current exception in C++ in gdb?,16400570,"<p>Short answer: you can't because most work of exception handling is done outside of your program, and is therefore outside of gdb's scope.</p>

<p>Explained answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sometimes the line an exception is thrown has no symbols</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the binary you're debugging has no debug symbols then the binary is probably stripped and you won't be able to find much at all about the types/values of anything at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I inspect the value of the current exception?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you're assuming here that an exception is a language feature that gdb can inspect; in fact an exception in C++ is a combination of features from C++ as a language, of libc++ and the ABI. And there might even be more than a single active current exception.</p>

<p>Like UpAndAdam points out you can set a breakpoint in a catch block with a type specifier, and then inspect that element, but I suspect your problem is in cases where you find a ""catch (...)"". In those cases you won't be able to learn much about the current exception unless you go digging into the implementation of exception handling.</p>

<p>With a very short and incomplete description we could say that to throw an exception:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your program will call libc++ to raise an exception</li>
<li>libc++ will call ""unwind"" in glibc to start the stack unwinding</li>
<li>unwind will call back a ""personality function"" from libc++ for each stack frame (each function call in the stack, basically)</li>
<li>the personality function will somehow decide if the current stack frame can or can't handle this exception</li>
<li>if the exception can be handled the catch block will be executed</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, it's difficult to talk about details because a lot of exception handling depends on your toolchain (compiler, platform, architecture, libc++, etc) but in most cases a ""catch (...)"" won't even receive the original exception as an argument. In any case, to somehow answer your question: in gcc with gnu's libc++ you could try something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a libc++ with debugging symbols</li>
<li>Set a breakpoint in __gxx_personality_v0 (that's called the personality function). This function will get called to determine whether a stack frame (a function call, basically) has a suitable catch block to handle the exception</li>
<li>In the personality function you'll be able to find a pointer to _Unwind_Exception, which is a wrapper to your real exception</li>
<li>Get the type info for your exception like this:
__cxa_exception *exception_header = (__cxa_exception*)(unwind_exception+1)-1;
std::type_info *thrown_exception_type = exception_header->exceptionType;</li>
<li>You'll get an exception type which you can then lookup with the rest of the RTTI defined for your code</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, you'll probably need to spend quite a bit of time trying to understand how exception handling is implemented in your platform. If you want to read a bit more about exception handling I spent some time in the past writing about the topic @ <a href=""http://monoinfinito.wordpress.com/series/exception-handling-in-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monoinfinito.wordpress.com/series/exception-handling-in-c/</a>.

  <p>I know I could fix this with an else for the last statement, but I often prefer to be explicit. </p>

<p>You can remain explicit without telling the compiler. Since the only reason to be explicit is to help human readers, a comment in place of the actual <code>if</code> gives you the best of both worlds: programmers see the condition, while compilers don't bother you with unnecessary <code>throw</code>s or <code>return</code>s.</p>

<pre><code>if ( home == away )
    return MatchResult.Draw;
else if ( home &gt; away )
    return MatchResult.HomeWins;
else // if ( home &lt; away )
    return MatchResult.AwayWins;
</code></pre>

<p>In situations where you genuinely need to throw an exception because some branch is impossible to reach the best course of action is to use assertions:</p>

<pre><code>if (!CheckNonNegative(arg)) {
    throw new ArgumentException(nameof(arg));
}
...
if (arg == 0) {
    ... // Do something
} else {
    Debug.Assert(arg &gt; 0, ""Method has checked arg to be non-negative"");

<p>Just about the only time you should <code>catch (...)</code> and not rethrow the exception would be in <code>main()</code> to catch any otherwise unhandled exceptions and to display or log an error before exiting.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: as Noah Roberts pointed out, about the only the only time this might be a reasonable idea would be in a destructor. It is important to suppress exceptions in destructors, otherwise you could have multiple exceptions active. This could happen, for example, if an exception is thrown, and as a result of the stack unwinding some destructor is called. If that destructor throws an exception, you'll have 2 exceptions active. C++ will then call std::terminate(), which by default will end your program. You can install a handler for this condition, but there probably isn't much you can do other than log what is happening.</p>

<p>Still, even in a destructor, you should probably log something inside the <code>catch (...)</code>. However, depending on which destructor it is, you may not have your logging facility available. But in most cases you could still use <code>std::cerr</code>.</p>

better use <strong><code>zmq_poll()</code></strong> as a <strong>cheapest ever detection</strong> of a presence ( or not presence ) of any read-able message ( already delivered and being ready so as to be received ), before ever, if at all, calling an API function of a <code>zmq_recv()</code>, to fetch such data into your application-level code's hands, from inside the <code>Context()</code>-instance internal storage.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br>
depending on your language binding (wrapper), best enjoy the <strong>non-blocking forms</strong> of the <code>.poll()</code>, <code>.send()</code> and <code>.recv()</code> methods. The native API is the most straightforward in always going in this mode with <strong><code>retCode = zmq_recv( ..., ZMQ_NOBLOCK );</code></strong></p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><br>
<strong>Always analyse</strong> the <strong><code>retCode</code></strong> - be it in a silent or explanatory <code>assert( retCode == 0 &amp;&amp; zmq_errno() )</code> or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong><br>
Best review and <strong>fine-tune all configuration attributes</strong> of the instantiated tools available from ZeroMQ framework and harness all their hidden strengths to best match your application domain's needs. Many native API-settings may help mitigate, if not principally avoid, lots of colliding requirements right inside the <code>Context()</code>-engine instance, so do not hesitate to learn all details of possible settings and use them to the best of their help for your code.</p>

<p>For YAML ,please see/read below:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accepted answer is using <a href=""https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-core/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/filter/RegexFilter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RegexFilter</a> and is an elegant solution for managing log filtering in Log4j2.</p>
<p>While implementing, encountered a scenario where it was needed to exclude a specific <code>Hibernate</code> error from being logged. As in our projects we are working with a <code>YAML</code> configuration, thus found it valuable to share the approach here, especially since most available examples on the internet tend to focus on <code>XML</code> configuration.</p>
<p>Below is an example of how to employ the <code>RegexFilter</code> within a <code>YAML</code> <code>Log4j2</code> configuration:</p>
<pre><code>  Loggers:
    logger:
      - name: org.hibernate.orm.jdbc.batch
        level: ERROR
        Filters:
          # Ignore log events with 'org.hibernate.StaleStateException' exception
          - RegexFilter:
              regex: &quot;.*org.hibernate.StaleStateException.*&quot;
              onMatch: DENY
              onMismatch: NEUTRAL
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the intent is to filter out logs related to <code>org.hibernate.StaleStateException</code>, preventing them from being recorded. This is achieved while allowing all other <code>error</code> logs from the <code>org.hibernate.orm.jdbc.batch</code> logger to be captured.</p>
<p>Feel free to customize it further according to your preference.</p>

<p>Perhaps it does something like returning <code>false</code> if there's an error, but throwing an exception if the input is invalid.</p>

<p>edit: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/772035/paulpro"">PaulPRO</a> posted a (now-deleted) answer pointing out that it is <em>technically</em> possible to cause an exception to be thrown in a different thread, while returning a value in the current one. I thought this was worth noting, even if it's not something you should ever see.</p>
"
7219963,Return a value AND throw an exception?,7220952,"<p>You can throw an exception that <em>has</em> a (in this case boolean) value:</p>

<p>I would love to a see a link to the documentation on this API. API's should place a priority on clarity. Throwing an exception and returning a value leaves the question of whether the value that was returned is safe to use or if it is invalid.</p>

<p>Remember, try/catch blocks are the OTHER method of handling exceptions. They don't pass the exception to the calling method, but handle it internally in a way that the developer deems appropriate.</p>

<p>If, for debugging purposes, you need to see the resulting value in the case of an exception, then Bohemian's idea works well.</p>

<p>and eliminate the Window_Closing event handler.  It's been a while since I worked with WPF, so I am assuming that ShowDialog does not give you the ""X"" close button at the top right of the window, so all you have to worry about is your own close button.  And what you want to do when they press that close button is start the animation, and it is actually the end of the animation that really closes the dialog, so leave the <code>this.Close()</code> to occur only on the storyboardComplete event.</p>

<p>Judging from the stack trace this is caused by Groovy so either your are using an old Groovy version that doesn't support JDK 9 or running code that imports <code>jdk.internal.loader</code> without declaring proper Java module access. </p>

<h2>Cause</h2>

<p>The issue has been identified and logged under Problem Report ID <code>ADAPT00765364</code>.
The error is likely caused because <code>Response.End()</code> is used inside the <code>ExportToHttpResponse()</code> method.<br>
It is a known issue that <code>Reponse.End()</code> causes the thread to abort. This is by design.<br>
See <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/312629"" rel=""noreferrer"">Microsoft KB312629 Article</a> for more info.</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>

   }
 catch (System.Threading.ThreadAbortException)
   {
   }
....
</code></pre>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>You can write your own code to export a Crystal Report directly to the browser in a format such as PDF, Word, Excel, etc. You must make sure you use the appropriate content type.</p>

<p>Sample code to export Crystal Report to web browser as PDF</p>

<pre><code>try
{
 boReportDocument.Load(Server.MapPath(@""MyReport.rpt""));
 System.IO.Stream oStream = null;
 byte[] byteArray = null;
 oStream = boReportDocument.ExportToStream (ExportFormatType.PortableDocFormat);
 byteArray = new byte[oStream.Length];
 oStream.Read(byteArray, 0, Convert.ToInt32(oStream.Length - 1));
 Response.ClearContent();
 Response.ClearHeaders();
 Response.ContentType = ""application/pdf"";
 Response.BinaryWrite(byteArray);
 Response.Flush();
 Response.Close();
 boReportDocument.Close();
 boReportDocument.Dispose();

Since your code maybe calling ExportToHttpResponse and then doing some other stuff, then the thread abort exception is raised.
So avoid any line of code after ExportToHttpResponse is called. Even with try-catch wrapping the abort exception is raised.</p>

52734085,Channel closed exception in pipeline,68862414,"<p>Any chance your Agent is started via SSH? We were facing this issue after migrating our Jenkins agents to a new server infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
Apparently on the new servers in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> a <code>RekeyLimit</code> was configured:</p>
<p><code>RekeyLimit 512M 1h</code></p>
<p>This meant that after 512 MB of transferred data or <strong>1h of connection time</strong>, the key was renegotiated. In our case, this renegotiation happened during steps like 'sshagent' oder 'withMaven' which lead to the exact exception you are describing.</p>
<p>It seems that this only happens for steps that run over a long-ish period of time, experience a key renegotiation <strong>and</strong> end with some sort of file operation - just like in your case.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
We resolved it by setting <code>RekeyLimit</code> in <code>etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> on the agent to its default value:</p>
<p><code>RekeyLimit default none</code></p>
<p>and then restarting the <code>sshd.service</code> and Jenkins' <code>remoting.jar</code>.</p>
<p>Setting the <code>RekeyLimit</code> to default effectively leads to the cipher deciding when to reconnect:</p>
<pre><code>$ man sshd_config
  RekeyLimit
    Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted before the session key is 
    renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session 
    key is renegotiated. [...] The default is between ‘1G’ and ‘4G’, depending on the cipher.  
    [...] The default value for RekeyLimit is default none, which means that rekeying is 
    performed after the cipher's default amount of data has been sent or received and no time 
    based rekeying is done.
</code></pre>
<p>This may still lead to random exceptions when the cipher's default amount of data is reached. We somewhat mitigated this by configuring the connection between Jenkins Master and Agent to disconnect when no jobs are running so that we (almost) never reach the cipher's default amount of data within the same ssh session.</p>

<p>To further clarify what happens, I believe that EF looks at the options (the DbContext's configuration) to get a sense of how many <em>functionally different</em> DbContexts you are using. It seems to consider more than twenty to be an indication of a mistake.</p>
<p>However, EF compares options by the equality of their contents. And interceptors, being simple reference types, have reference equality by default. Because of this, if each options object gets a new instance of an interceptor, suddenly the options objects are considered <em>different</em>, causing each to count towards EF's limit of twenty.</p>
<p>Integration tests are a common example where this issue may occur, when each integration test uses its own DI container and registers the same DbContext with a fresh interceptor instance. Instead of 20+ registrations of functionally the same DbContext, EF <em>believes</em> it is seeing 20+ registrations of <em>functionally different</em> DbContexts.</p>
<p>If Ivan's answer of using a truly singleton instance is an annoyance in your code base, an alternative solution is to have different instances of your interceptor be considered the same.</p>

    public override bool Equals(object? obj) =&gt; obj is MyInterceptor;

42542557,How to get the exception that was thrown when a Cucumber test failed in Java?,60682286,"<p>The problem with the work around suggested by Frank Escobar:</p>

<p>By using reflection to reach into a frameworks internals you're depending on implementation details. This is a bad practice, when ever the framework changes its implementation your code may break as you will observe in Cucumber v5.0.0.</p>

<p>Hooks in Cucumber are designed to manipulate the test execution context before and after a scenario. They're not made to report on the test execution itself. Reporting is cross cutting concern and best managed by using the plugin system.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>package com.example;

import io.cucumber.plugin.ConcurrentEventListener;
import io.cucumber.plugin.event.EventPublisher;
import io.cucumber.plugin.event.Result;
import io.cucumber.plugin.event.Status;
import io.cucumber.plugin.event.TestCase;
import io.cucumber.plugin.event.TestCaseFinished;

public class MyTestListener implements ConcurrentEventListener {
    @Override
    public void setEventPublisher(EventPublisher publisher) {
        publisher.registerHandlerFor(TestCaseFinished.class, this::handleTestCaseFinished);
    }

    private void handleTestCaseFinished(TestCaseFinished event) {
        TestCase testCase = event.getTestCase();
        Result result = event.getResult();
        Status status = result.getStatus();
        Throwable error = result.getError();
        String scenarioName = testCase.getName();
        String id = """" + testCase.getUri() + testCase.getLine();
        System.out.println(""Testcase "" + id + "" - "" + status.name());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When using JUnit 4 and TestNG you can activate this plugin using:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>@CucumberOptions(plugin=""com.example.MyTestListener"")

<p>With JUnit 5 you add it to <code>junit-platform.properties</code>:</p>

<p>Here are the bad solutions I have come up with:</p>

<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Break the good advice of ""don't make logic locale sensitive""</p>

<pre><code>using (var con = new SqlConnection(""Server=(local);Integrated Security=True;""))
{
    con.Open();

    try
    {
        var sqc = new SqlCommand(""WAITFOR DELAY '1:00:00'"", con);
        var readThread = Task.Run(() =&gt; sqc.ExecuteNonQuery());

        // cancel after 5 seconds
        Thread.Sleep(5000);
        sqc.Cancel();

        // this should throw
        await readThread;

        // unreachable
        Console.WriteLine(""Succeeded"");
    }
    catch (SqlException ex) when (ex.Number == 0 &amp;&amp; ex.State == 0 &amp;&amp; ex.Class == 11 
        &amp;&amp; ex.Message.Contains(""Operation cancelled by user.""))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Cancelled"");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Error"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Assume that no other severe locally generated error matters after a cancel has been issued</p>

<pre><code>using (var con = new SqlConnection(""Server=(local);Integrated Security=True;""))
{
    con.Open();

    bool isCancelled = false;
    try
    {
        var sqc = new SqlCommand(""WAITFOR DELAY '1:00:00'"", con);
        var readThread = Task.Run(() =&gt; sqc.ExecuteNonQuery());

        // cancel after 5 seconds

        isCancelled = true;
        sqc.Cancel();

        // this should throw

For this reason I've added some logic to ignore 404 and 405 errors, and may still add others that mostly contribute noise to the logfile.</p>
<hr />
<p>This was harder than it should have been, but this is the solution I'm currently using to log the request with <em>all</em> exceptions. It's probably not the cleanest way to do it, but it works perfectly for my needs. Thanks to John Lobo's <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/75413387/1191147"">answer</a> for pointing me in the right direction.</p>
<p>It works by inspecting each instance of the Exception class and using PHP's <code>instanceof</code> to check whether it's a HTTP exception or not. If it is, it gets logged with the request URL and returns a view with a status code. If it's a generic non-HTTP exception, it gets logged with the request URL and returns another view with no status code (or you can keep the default exception behaviour by removing the return block, which renders a blank screen in production).</p>
<pre><code>public function register()
{

$this-&gt;renderable(function (Exception $exception, $request) {

  $url = $request-&gt;fullUrl();

  if ($exception instanceof HttpException) {
  
  $status = $exception-&gt;getStatusCode();

  // Do not log HTTP 404 and 405s errors for reasons that will 
  // become apparent after a few hours of logging 404s and 405s

63536133,Creating new .Net Core Console Process: Exception when using environment variables with UseShellExecute=true,68914440,"<p>Since this is the top search result for the error message</p>

<p>The Process object must have the UseShellExecute property set to false in order to use environment variables</p>

<p>, I thought I would chime in with an observation after looking through reference source for <a href=""https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#system/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/ProcessStartInfo.cs,5611ad13d0b7376e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EnvironmentVariables</a> here

<p>Chances are, you're probably here because you're sitting in front of Visual Studio with a breakpoint trying to figure out what the right magic is to make UseShellExecute work.</p>
<p>If you look through the locals or immediate windows, or you serialize the ProcessStartInfo class object, or basically do anything that might directly or indirectly access ProcessStartInfo.EnvironmentVariables, the code will instantiate the collection and populate it! Then, when you actually try to start the process, the beginning part of the method throws out your config as invalid.</p>
<p>The only way to make UseShellExecute work is to ensure the environmentVariables backing field stays null, and to do that means, you can't access it any way (directly or indirectly).</p>

<p>I did all that was recommended, except, I populated the <code>WorkingDirectory</code> too. And it did not work. Gave me that damn error message.</p>
<p>The source code for the <code>ProcessStartInfo</code> gives a hint to what's happening.</p>
<pre><code>//
// Summary:
//     When the System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute property is false,
//     gets or sets the working directory for the process to be started. When System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute

49352711,Uncatchable exception in DataGridView when deleting rows in datatable,49353590,"<p>Just read your question again. This was working for years. Now it's not working, cause you added timer, running in a new, separate thread.
This might be a race condition.
Obviously, dt is a shared resource which is not properly used in a multithreaded environment. 
Assuming <code>dt</code> is source of your data grid view, in one situation, user might be doing something with it (just scrolling would be enough to read from dt in order to paint newly visible rows - thus, I suppose you get the PaintWork error from there, as the state was changed in the mean time by a timer event handler). Imagine user deletes row from the grid, that reflects to the underlying source <code>dt</code>, but, your timer just happened to delete those rows just a moment ago and you get index out of range exception.</p>

<p>Instead of working with <code>dt</code> in your timer event handler, can you try and make a copy of it <code>dt_copy</code> (just pay attention not to make a shallow copy). Make your changes, and once you're done, just bind that copy as a new source of datagridview and all should be good.</p>

<p>Another approach, which also might perform faster would be to call stored procedure and do deletion by database directly and just refresh your <code>dt</code> once that call returns (just repopulate <code>dt</code>).</p>

<p>In both cases, depending how fast deletion is, you should check if 'dt' is dirty (updated by a user in the mean time) and might want to merge those changes so they are not lost.</p>
"
49352711,Uncatchable exception in DataGridView when deleting rows in datatable,49352842,"<p>The problem over here is, that you´r calling the delete row.delete statement inside your for loop. This is manipulating the length of your row collection thus you get the index out of bound exception. </p>

<p>One thing I would try is to see if you can get the debugger to break when the exception is thrown (using Debug > Exceptions). You'll have to explicitly enable this, but if you know what type of exception is thrown, this might allow you to work out where it's thrown.</p>

<p>Other than that, putting a breakpoint in the constructor of the exception (if it's one of your own) should also allow you to work out where it's triggered from.</p>

<p>If those methods don't work for you I'd be looking at the debug messages as you already suggested.</p>

<p>And you get a nice log file and some dumps you can use to view the state of the process when the exception happened with WinDBG.  The log file will have analysis of the error that occurred, including the line of code that caused the error.  It will also list the call-stack for each thread.  In the call stack listing, the thread with the <code>#</code> next to it's number is the one that caused the exception.  There is a TON of information in these files.

70060730,Activity error with ActivityInjector get life cycle exception,77033301,"<p>I think this is a problem with Xiaomi phone models.</p>
<p>I think in your code super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) is called before the theme setting code. Therefore, when the app is launched, the basic activity operations start before the day/night mode is still set. This means that some operations that happen before the setDefaultNightMode operation can affect the operation of the app and thus lead to error messages.</p>
<p>In your new code, if super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) is called after the day/night mode settings have been checked using AppDelegate. This ensures that the night/day mode setting is done correctly before the underlying activity operations, so that possible mismatches or errors can be avoided.</p>
<p>So basically, calling super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) after setting the day/night mode allows you to follow a proper sequence and avoid errors.</p>

<p>at the bottom. Either for SystemBus or SessionBus. I used SessionBus. Although 18512 is not a limit found in those files, so it's all a guess.</p>
<p>Well, adding <code>close()</code> and <code>SessionBus()</code> in the test program loop before calling <code>get_object()</code>, fixed the crash, it ran through the previous 18512 threshold.
Probably resetting any of the limits.</p>

Reload &#128473;,64395834,"<p>I had almost the same problem, but not because I deleted <em>per se</em> the two <code>#blazor-error-ui</code> rules cited in Noor's response. Wanting to use the same components for both server- and WASM-based versions of my app, I initially split the (server-based) app into two projects, one bare-boned with <code>Pages/_Host.cshtml</code> and a few other critical files, the other project with everything else—including all CSS files. The symptoms described in the original post appeared, but only when the user switched languages and only momentarily.</p>
<p>My remedy was to create a separate CSS file with the two <code>#blazor-error-ui</code> rules, name it <code>Host.css</code>, and place it in <code>wwwroot/css</code> of the bare-boned project. Then I added the following line to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of <code>_Host.cshtml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/Host.css&quot; /&gt;

<p>(The name and location of the new CSS file aren't important, as long as they're in the project with <code>_Host.cshtml</code> and the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>'s <code>href</code> attribute correctly identifies the file.)</p>

error “80080005 Server execution failed (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80080005 (CO_E_SERVER_EXEC_FAILURE))” could occur due to following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The machine has a high CPU load and the process takes a long time to
start and fails to execute the CoRegisterClassObjects() in less than
120 seconds.</li>
<li>The COM server doesn't register for the right class IDs.</li>
<li>The COM server is currently stopping and there is a race condition
between CoCreateInstance and the COM server stopping part.</li>
<li>There is a security problem in the way the COM server is started

77018802,Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NumberFormatException: Cannot parse null string,77022430,"<p>So now you know the deal. To simply recap, the <a href=""https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/number_parseint.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Integer.parseInt()</a> method can only accept a string consisting of <em>one</em> or <em>more</em> digits from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>9</strong> <em>(no spaces at all)</em> but, only up to <a href=""https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-integermaxvalue"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Integer.MAX_VALUE</a> which happens to be <code>2147483647</code> OR <a href=""https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-integerminvalue-in-java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Integer.MIN_VALUE</a> which happens to be <code>-2147483648</code>. Yes, there are two specific characters the <a href=""https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/number_parseint.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Integer.parseInt()</a> method will accept and they are the <em>plus</em> (<strong>+</strong>) character (which basically indicates an <em>unsigned</em>, positive value and is rarely used) and the <strong>minus</strong> (<em>-</em>) character which indicates a <em>signed</em> (negative) value.</p>
<p>If there are any alpha characters within the argument passed to the <a href=""https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/number_parseint.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Integer.parseInt()</a> method (including any white-spaces) other than <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>, then the method will fail with a <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NumberFormatException.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NumberFormatException</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/lang/double_parsedouble.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Double.parseDouble()</a> method works in very much the same fashion however, it does accept more alpha characters, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.</code> Decimal Point (period)       {only after the whole number portion
of the string: <code>&quot;234.342&quot;</code>);</li>
<li><code>+</code> Unsigned designator          (only at the beginning of the
string: <code>&quot;+234.342&quot;</code>);</li>
<li><code>-</code> Signed designator            (only at the beginning of the
string: <code>&quot;-234.342&quot;</code>);</li>
<li><code>d</code> or <code>D</code> Double Type indicator (only at the end of the string: <code>&quot;234.342D&quot;</code>);</li>
<li><code>f</code> or <code>F</code> Float Type indicator  (only at the end of the string: <code>&quot;234.342F&quot;</code>);</li>
<li><code>e</code> or <code>E</code> Exponent Notation     (only within the decimal portion of
the string: <code>&quot;234.34E2&quot;</code>);</li>
</ul>
<p>And, you can also supply a string representation of an Integer value (whole number) to this method and it will convert it to Double Type, for example:</p>
<pre><code>double dblValue = Double.parseDouble(&quot;234&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dbleValue</code> variable will hold: <code>234.0</code></p>
<p>As already explained to you, the Input Dialog will return <code>null</code> when the <kbd>Cancel</kbd> button is selected or the dialog window is closed with the <kbd>X</kbd> button in the upper-right corner. Obviously, this needs to be dealt with and the best way to that is to <strong>validate</strong> the data you receive from the User. If the User makes a mistake then, inform that User and let him or her try again on the same prompt. Each bit of data entry provided from the User should be validated so to eliminate problems down the road. Deal with those problems at the entry level.</p>

"
13826578,Unhandled Exception in Dart,13835496,"<p>Once you realize what is going on, understanding the issue is pretty simple.</p>

<p>The problem is: the semantics of traditional control flow constructs (<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>try/catch/finally</code>, <code>return</code>) is purely <em>synchronous</em>. They expect that the program flows just like its source code flows. Take a look at this:</p>

<pre><code>1      try {
2        while (...) {
3          if (...) {
4            doSomething();
5            doSomethingElse();
6          }
7        }
8      } catch (e) {
9        print('oh no, something wrong happen! error: $e');
10     } finally {
11       print('done!');
12     }
</code></pre>

<p>This program works as a sequence. The line 1 is executed before line 2 which is executed before line 3 etc. Line 5 is executed immediatelly after line 4. Line 11 is executed after line 7, and if an exception happens, line 11 is also executed after line 9. That's what <em>synchronous</em> means.</p>

<p>However, synchronous programs are no longer good enough. Event handling is naturally <em>asynchronous</em>, and you will find events everywhere -- from user interfaces to highly scalable network servers. So if you write</p>

<pre><code>1      try {
2        var text = 'this will be replaced by the content of the file';
3        new File('...').readAsText().then((result) {
4          text = result;
5          doSomethingThatMightCauseAnException(text);
6          print('read file, got $text');
7        });
8        print('invoked file read');
9        return text;
10     } catch (e) {
11       print('error: $e');
12     }
</code></pre>

<p>you have to understand that you are invoking an asynchronous operation (the <code>readAsText</code> method). In this program, line 2 executes after line 1 and line 3 goes after line 2, but line 4 <strong>doesn't</strong> execute after line 3. The file reading is invoked asynchronously (think ""in the background"") and the program continues. So in this situation, after line 3, you will get directly to line 8. And so the <code>return</code> statement on line 9 (which follows line 8) always returns the <code>'this will be replaced by the content of the file'</code> text.</p>

<p>Then, the program goes on and on, until it is done (it exits the <code>main</code> function). But it <em>doesn't stop</em>, because there is some code running ""in the background"" and there is a handler registered for it (you registered the handler by calling the <code>then</code> method). Once the system finishes reading the file, it will call the handler (the anonymous function you passed to the <code>then</code> method). Only when there is no handler for some asynchronous invocation registered, the program can stop.</p>

<p>And now, you probably understand that the exception handler on line 10 can <em>only</em> catch an error that happens on line 3 (error opening the file). But if an exception happens on line 5, it <strong>can't</strong> be caught on line 10, because that <code>catch</code> handler is long gone.</p>

<p>The rest is just a matter of using the API properly. If you work with callbacks, you have to pass an success handler <em>and</em> an error handler, if you work with <code>Future</code>s, you have to call the <code>then</code> method with a success handler <em>and</em> the <code>handleException</code> method with an error handler.</p>
"
13826578,Unhandled Exception in Dart,77019801,"<p>I was struggling with this too, and I didn't wanted to use <code>catchError</code> because I think it is too verbose, so I realized I was missing the <code>await</code> before calling the <code>Future</code> inside the <code>try catch</code>. So, the code must be like that:</p>
<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>Future&lt;void&gt; doSomething() async {
    try {
        return await Future.error(Exception()); //&lt;-- notice this await!
    } catch (e) {
        debugPrint(&quot;Something wrong happended!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>await</code> was missed, there's no compile error because the method return is a <code>Future</code> too, but the exception must be caught upstream.</p>

<p>Since there is no <code>$CRED_TYPE</code> global variable, evaluating the expression <code>$GLOBALS['CRED_TYPE']</code> produces a notice (<em>""Undefined index: CRED_TYPE'""</em>) and the custom error handler set by your project generates and throws an <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/class.errorexception.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ErrorException</code></a> from it.

<pre><code>WebElement pageElement = driver.findElement(By.id(""someId""));
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(webDriver, 10);

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.stalenessOf(pageElement));

<p>In this case, you don't have to do <code>pageElement.click()</code>, etc. to trigger the check.</p>

<p><code>logging.exception</code> will emit the stacktrace alongside the localized error message, which makes it quite useful.</p>

<p>The exc_info parameter in the logging.error call is set to True, allowing the logging module to include the exception information, including the traceback, in the log output.
The localized error message is stored in a variable error_message, which makes the code more readable and allows for easy changes if needed.</p>

<p>You want to catch the various exceptions in order, like so:</p>

<pre><code>try 
{
    //some code
}
catch(TypeOfException exOne) 
{
    //handle TypeOfException someway

catch (OtherTypeOfException exTwo)

}
catch (Exception ex) 
{
    //handle unknown exceptions in a general way
}
finally 
{
    //any required cleanup code goes here
}

<p>Try to put the most unusual exceptions at the top, working your way down the list towards more common ones. The catch sequence is sequential - if you put catch(Exception) at the top, it will always catch on that line no matter what exceptions you code for beneath it.</p>

76978692,"How can a constructor signal to caller, whether an exception it is throwing is fatal?",76978891,"<p>A question edit overlapped with writing this answer. The original answer is below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can the value_type's constructor signal to the function, that the exception it is throwing should not considered fatal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that in your current code you already do make a distinction between exceptions inherited from <code>std::exception</code> and those that do not inherit from <code>std::exception</code>. Good style is to inherit all exceptions from <code>std::exception</code> but reality is usually different.</p>
<p>You could introduce some special type of exception to be thrown:</p>
<pre><code>            try {
                 //...
            } catch (const non_fatal_exception &amp;e) {
                    // do something
            } catch (...) { // all other exceptions are &quot;fatal&quot;

                    goto failure;
            }
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Old answer about dynamic exception specifications...</p>
<p>As mentiond in comments, dynamic exception specifications are removed from C++17.</p>
<p>Before C++17 a function that did throw an exception not listed in the exception specification did the following (from <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/except_spec"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cppreference</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the function throws an exception of the type not listed in its exception specification, the function <code>std::unexpected</code> is called. The default function calls <code>std::terminate</code>, but it may be replaced by a user-provided function (via <code>std::set_unexpected</code>) which may call <code>std::terminate</code> or throw an exception.  If the exception thrown from <code>std::unexpected</code> is accepted by the exception specification, stack unwinding continues as usual. If it isn't, but <code>std::bad_exception</code> is allowed by the exception specification, <code>std::bad_exception</code> is thrown. Otherwise, <code>std::terminate</code> is called.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no way out unless you know some exception that would be accepted from the exception specification, but in general you do not know that. I am not aware of deducing the &quot;allowed&quot; exceptions in generic code. Anyhow, the feature is removed. And in some sense it was already &quot;fatal&quot; to throw an exception not listed in the exception specification, its not something you have to do extra.</p>

881473,Why catch and rethrow an exception in C#?,881489,"<p>First, the way that the code in the article does it is evil. <code>throw ex</code> will reset the call stack in the exception to the point where this throw statement is losing the information about where the exception actually was created.</p>
<p>Second, if you just catch and re-throw like that, I see no added value. The code example above would be just as good (or, given the <code>throw ex</code> bit, even better) without the try-catch.</p>
<p>However, there are cases where you might want to catch and rethrow an exception. Logging could be one of them:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>    try 
    {
        // code that may throw exceptions    
    }
    catch(Exception ex) 
    {
        // add error logging here
        throw;

<pre><code>try

   throw ex;

<p>You'll lose the stack trace information...</p>

<p>Either do,</p>

</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>try { ... }
catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw new Exception(""My Custom Error Message"", ex);
}

<p>One of the reason you might want to rethrow is if you're handling different exceptions, for
e.g.</p>

<pre><code>try
{
   ...
}
catch(SQLException sex)
{
   //Do Custom Logging 
   //Don't throw exception - swallow it here

881473,Why catch and rethrow an exception in C#?,881549,"<p>C# (before C# 6) doesn't support CIL ""filtered exceptions"", which VB does, so in C# 1-5 one reason for re-throwing an exception is that you don't have enough information at the time of catch() to determine whether you wanted to actually catch the exception. </p>

<p>For example, in VB you can do</p>

<pre><code>Try
 ..
Catch Ex As MyException When Ex.ErrorCode = 123
 .. 
End Try

75304491,Difference between bare except and specifying a specific exception,75304535,"<p>The point of specifying the Exception is that ONLY that Exception will be caught, if you do not specify any Exception, then ALL Errors and Exceptions will be caught potentially masking bugs.</p>
<p>For example let's say that I want to read a file if it exists or otherwise print a message to the user, I can write:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    with ope(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) as f:
        print(f.read())
except:
    print(&quot;File not found&quot;)

<p>But while this code runs fine without raising any exceptions, this code will never read the file, even if it exists!!!</p>
<p>This is because I wrote <code>ope</code> instead of <code>open</code> and the <code>NameError</code> was caught by my bare <code>except</code>, If I write the <code>except</code> in the correct way:</p>

    with ope(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) as f:
        print(f.read())

75304491,Difference between bare except and specifying a specific exception,75304648,"<p>Just to add to the answer provided by @Caridorc, by specifying each error separately, you can run specific error handling code pertaining to that error when the exception arises. If for example the file does not exist, you can print message to that effect. If however, it fails to print because you mistyped g instead of f, you can print a message to say that the variable is not recognised ( separate code for separate error captures). For exmple:</p>
<pre><code>g = 100 # Unrelated variable declared previously
try:
    with open(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) as f:
        x=print(f.read())

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(&quot;File not found&quot;)
except AttributeError:
    print(&quot;Reading wrong variable&quot;)
except Exception as e:
    print(&quot;Unknown Error&quot;, e)
</code></pre>
<p>Note also the last exception <code> except Exception as e:</code>. This is the same as just <code>except:</code> but allows you to handle all other errors that do not fit onto previous captures and retrieve e - the error message that is generated by compiler. There is effectively no difference between <code>except:</code> and <code>except Exception:</code> in terms of execution</p>

37944988,Apache CXF Policy Exception (WS Security)- Security configuration could not be detected,42441487,"<p>I spent a few days solving this and additional issues with Apache CXF 3.1.4. Fact is, the Error messages in CXF seldom provide the true clue about what to fix. The one at stake is quite typical: it tells about a name not found but does not provide the actual value that is looked up, and second, that was not the issue in my context. </p>

<p>I was starting from an XML/Spring-based CXF bus/policy configuration working in test and prod for over a year, and like:</p>

<pre><code>SpringBusFactory bf = new SpringBusFactory();
URL busFile = MyClient.class.getResource(""/wssec_policy.xml"");
Bus bus = bf.createBus(busFile);
BusFactory.setDefaultBus(bus);
</code></pre>

<p>where the wssec_policy.xml contained the jaxws:client definition as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;beans xmlns=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"" xmlns:cxf=""http://cxf.apache.org/core"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:jaxws=""http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws"" xsi:schemaLocation=""...etc...""&gt;
&lt;bean id=""logOutbound"" class=""MyLoggingOutInterceptor""/&gt;
&lt;bean id=""logInbound"" class=""MyLoggingInInterceptor""/&gt;
&lt;cxf:bus&gt;
    &lt;cxf:outInterceptors&gt;&lt;ref bean=""logOutbound""/&gt;&lt;/cxf:outInterceptors&gt;
    &lt;cxf:inInterceptors&gt;&lt;ref bean=""dumpMessageInterceptor""/&gt;&lt;ref bean=""logInbound""/&gt;&lt;/cxf:inInterceptors&gt;
    &lt;cxf:features&gt;&lt;cxf:logging/&gt;&lt;/cxf:features&gt;
&lt;/cxf:bus&gt;
&lt;jaxws:client name=""{http://some.domain/webservices}servicioSoap"" createdFromAPI=""true""&gt;
        &lt;jaxws:properties&gt;
            &lt;entry key=""security.encryption.properties"" value=""etc/Client_Encrypt.properties""/&gt;
            &lt;entry key=""security.signature.properties"" value=""etc/Client_Sign.properties""/&gt;
        &lt;/jaxws:properties&gt;
    &lt;/jaxws:client&gt;
&lt;/beans&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and where encryption and signature.properties contain <a href=""https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/config.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WSS4J properties</a>.</p>

<p>My challenge was just to get this working with CXF 3.1.4, BouncyCastle 1.52, Spring 4.2.4, on JRE 8; which did not, banging first on the error you cite.</p>

<p>I assembled the code in a POJO client and started drilling down in CXF source code to find the true cause, and discovered that the default bus setup as above (which did work previously) no longer supplied the jaxws:client meta-data to WSS4J layers. No data, hence the error. Apache CXF supplies three ways of configuring your WS-* stack (Explicit Interceptors, policy-based with XML, and policy-based via Java API). 
To solve your issue, I switched to policy-based config via the java API as follows:</p>

<pre><code>serviceGDS = new WSDL2Java_generated_Service();
portGDS = serviceGDS.getServiceGdsSoap();
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; ctx = ((javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider)portGDS).getRequestContext();
Properties encProps = new Properties();
encProps.load(new FileInputStream(""etc/Client_Encrypt.properties""));
ctx.put(""security.encryption.properties"", encProps);
Properties signProps = new Properties();
signProps.load(new FileInputStream(""etc/Client_Sign.properties""));
ctx.put(""security.signature.properties"", signProps);
// setting the props below once helped solving the error at stake
ctx.put(""security.signature.username"",""test_keypair"");
ctx.put(""security.encryption.username"",""gds_test_cert"");
</code></pre>

<p>The last two properties were once needed to progress in debugging, solving <em>wrong key length</em> errors due to missing key alias!!! But at the very end, I noted that it worked back without them! (they actually duplicate keystore alias in the Client_Encrypt and Client_Sign properties).</p>

<p>I then solved <em>no certificate found for encryption</em> errors by suppressing ""org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.provider=BC"" from Client_Encrypt and Client_Sign properties (yet worked in the past version).</p>

<p>I solved <em>missing certificate</em> errors by switching from <strong>pkcs12</strong> keystore type to <strong>jks</strong>. I discovered that keystore.load() does not fetch all the contained certificates... with the same p12 keystore I get varying outcome according to the context in which it is called... buggy indeed.</p>

<p>I solved <em>AsymmetricBinding is not supported</em> by observing that the re-deployment in a live server (JBoss EAP7 in my case) never worked, but when the deployed app starts along with the server (hence after server reboot), it works. I strongly suspect class loader issues.</p>

<p>Let me add that I once switched back to JRE 7 (where legacy runs OK) and the errors were significantly different (I suspect policy config files in the JRE).</p>

<p>Another major difficulty is that all errors, be it client side exceptions on handling the request or even the response, as well as server side faults, are all wrapped by CXF as soap faults with terse error messages making it very difficult to understand what's really happening. The only way left that allowed me to progress was assembling needed client code in a POJO and debugging it with help of CXF and WSS4J source code libraries( Eclipse/Maven fetches the source code for you while you use the debugger and drill down... efficient!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Async void methods have different error-handling semantics. When an exception is thrown out of an async Task or async Task method, that exception is captured and placed on the Task object. With async void methods, there is no Task object, so any exceptions thrown out of an async void method will be raised directly on the SynchronizationContext that was active when the async void method started.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that using <code>Wait()</code> may cause your application to block, if .NET decides to execute your method synchronously.</p>

5383310,Catch an exception thrown by an async void method,16158374,"<p>The reason the exception is not caught is because the Foo() method has a void return type and so when await is called, it simply returns.

<p>You will notice that the Run method completes on thread 2820 while only one child thread has finished (2756). If you put a try/catch around your await method you can ""catch"" the exception in the usual way although your code is executed on another thread when the calculation task has finished and your contiuation is executed. </p>

<p>The calculation method traces the thrown exception automatically because I did use the ApiChange.Api.dll from the <a href=""http://apichange.codeplex.com/releases"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ApiChange</a> tool.
Tracing and Reflector helps a lot to understand what is going on. To get rid of threading you can create your own versions of GetAwaiter BeginAwait and EndAwait and wrap not a task but e.g. a Lazy and trace inside your own extension methods. Then you will get much better understanding what the compiler and what the TPL does.</p>

<p>Now you see that there is no way to get in a try/catch your exception back since there is no stack frame left for any exception to propagate from. Your code might be doing something totally different after you did initiate the async operations. It might call Thread.Sleep or even terminate. As long as there is one foreground thread left your application will happily continue to execute asynchronous tasks. </p>

<hr>

<p>You can handle the exception inside the async method after your asynchronous operation did finish and call back into the UI thread. The recommended way to do this is with <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997394.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TaskScheduler.FromSynchronizationContext</a>. That does only work if you have an UI thread and it is not very busy with other things.</p>

<p>Yes, the accepted answer is a workaround for your problem -&gt; you can go to Debug&gt;Windows&gt;Exception Setting and choose &quot;System.InvalidOperationException&quot; as described in the answer above.</p>
<p>However, this will then break always any &quot;System.InvalidOperationException&quot; even if the exception is handled in a try and catch block.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I suggest you open the &quot;Call Stack window&quot; (Debug &gt; Windows &gt; Call stack).</p>
<p>Here (not sure if this is a new feature in Visual Studio 2022 because in Visual Studio 2019 I don't have this problem) you will see two nearly identical call stacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>One starting with [Exception] like &quot;[Exception] ... call stack data ...&quot;</li>
<li>and another identical but without [Exception] like &quot;... call stack data ...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you double click on the second one your local variables are filled - while in the first one with [Exception] your local variables are not filled (which is the default one in case of an exception.</p>
<p>Indirectly this behavior is also described in your error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Local variables and arguments are not available in '[Exception]' call stack frames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I've no idea why Visual Studio 2022 now creates two similar call stacks in case of an exception while Visual Studio 2019 doesn't.</p>

<p>The issue was simply that the <code>Workbook.Open</code> hadn't finished when I gave a <code>Worksheet.SaveAs</code> command.  So sometimes, the script would work, sometimes not.</p>
<p>I simply added a pause in the script after <code>Workbook.Open</code> and it worked.  I went on to find a property <code>Ready</code>, which allowed me to do exactly what I wanted:</p>
<pre><code>$excel = New-Object -ComObject &quot;Excel.Application&quot; -ea Stop
$wb = $excel.Workbooks.Open($workbook)
$sheet = $wb.Sheets(&quot;List&quot;)
while (-not $excel.Ready) {

<p>Note: It's a risk to allocate storage in an exception, things get really bad if that storage can't be allocated and you wind up with a throw in a throw, but you can mitigate this with a pre-allocated array, and avoiding the use of <code>std::string</code> by going old school with <code>sprintf</code> or similar.</p>

21938,Is it really that bad to catch a general exception?,21950,"<p>Obviously this is one of those questions where the only real answer is ""it depends.""</p>

<p>The main thing it depends on is where your are catching the exception.  In general libraries should be more conservative with catching exceptions whereas at the top level of your program (e.g. in your main method or in the top of the action method in a controller, etc) you can be more liberal with what you catch.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that e.g. you don't want to catch all exceptions in a library because you may mask problems that have nothing to do with your library, like ""OutOfMemoryException"" which you really would prefer bubbles up so that the user can be notified, etc.  On the other hand, if you are talking about catching exceptions inside your main() method which catches the exception, displays it and then exits... well, it's probably safe to catch just about any exception here.</p>

<p>The most important rule about catching all exceptions is that you should never just swallow all exceptions silently... e.g. something like this in Java:</p>

<pre><code>try { 
    something(); 
} catch (Exception ex) {}
</code></pre>

<p>or this in Python:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    something()
except:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>Because these can be some of the hardest issues to track down.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is that you should only catch exceptions that you can properly deal with yourself.  If you cannot handle the exception completely then you should let it bubble up to someone who can.</p>
"
21938,Is it really that bad to catch a general exception?,21947,"<p>Unless you are doing some logging and clean up code in the front end of your application, then I think it is bad to catch all exceptions.</p>

<p>My basic rule of thumb is to catch all the exceptions you expect and anything else is a bug.</p>

<p>If you catch everything and continue on, it's a bit like putting a sticking plaster over the warning light on your car dashboard. You can't see it anymore, but it doesn't mean everything is ok.</p>
"
21938,Is it really that bad to catch a general exception?,21955,"<p>Yes! (except at the ""top"" of your application)</p>

<p>By catching an exception and allowing the code execution to continue, you are stating that you know how do deal with and circumvent, or fix a particular problem. You are stating that this is <strong>a recoverable situation</strong>. Catching Exception or SystemException means that you will catch problems like IO errors, network errors, out-of-memory errors, missing-code errors, null-pointer-dereferencing and the likes. It is a lie to say that you can deal with these. </p>

<p>In a well organised application, these unrecoverable problems should be handled high up the stack.</p>

<p>In addition, as code evolves, you don't want your function to catch a new exception that is added <em>in the future</em> to a called method.</p>

If your code shallows an exception it kinda-sorta knew what do do with, you'll have a bug that ships. (This is a big difference between C# and Java - good Java programmers don't think this way, but the Java language tends to coerce this behavior in beginners)</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should be using try/finally (perhaps in the form of <code>using</code> or <code>lock</code> (both of which implement try/finally under the covers)) more often than try/catch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never (well, almost never) catch and swallow an exception and do nothing with it - that's a shipped bug waiting to happen. Consider:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>try {
    // some code
}
catch (Exception) {
    // no code here
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>That exception is gone, never logged, never noticed</em></p>
<p>Perhaps you want to log the exception and let it bubble up, so you try:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>try {
    // some code
}
catch (Exception ex) {
    // log the exception, then
    throw ex;
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>that's better, but the stack info for the original exception (i.e., the information you need to debug the issue) is mostly gone.</em></p>
<p>The correct way to do this is:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>try {
    // some code
}
catch (Exception ex) {
    // log the exception, then
    throw;    // rethrows the original exception
}
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, you want to <em>translate</em> the exception to something application-specific. In this case, you can use the exception constructor that takes an <em>inner exception</em>. That way, the information obout the original exception is not lost:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>try {
    // some code
}
catch (LowLevelException ex) {
    // log the exception, then
    throw new ApplicationAppropriateExeption (&quot;Low Level Error&quot;, ex);
}
</code></pre>
<p>There is a lot of information about exception handling on the internet (much of it opinionated and even philosophical). Pick a language before you start looking (the differences between Java and C# aren't just philosophical, they are syntactic and semantic).</p>
<p>The other thing is that much of the programming you will do will be in the context of an application whose structure someone else has determined. In those cases, it's important that you follow the existing exception handling standards for the app.</p>

76794989,Exception Handling : What exception to expect,76795075,"<p>Like most of the times in software design, the answer is - it depends.</p>
<p>Sometimes you kind of want the exception to &quot;make noise&quot; so you don't catch it, in order to expose unexpected behavior. Sometimes - you don't know what exception might come, but you make a decision that you don't want the program to crash - so you catch <code>Exception</code>, the most generic type.</p>
<p>In other cases, and let's take for example JSON serialization logic, you want to respond in one way if there was an issue while generating the JSON so you'll have a catch block for <code>JsonGenerationException</code>, but you'd like to do something different if file could not be written to the disk, so you'll have another catch block for <code>IOException</code>.</p>
<p>And there are much more cases...but bottom line - it depends.</p>

76794989,Exception Handling : What exception to expect,76795051,"<p>I don't think there are ways to know which exceptions can occur. While writing some set of code, developers should have an idea like what sort of exceptions can be expected. I don't know if there are any tools to know exceptions beforehand. Moreover, <em>Intellisense</em> might help you while writing code in Visual Studio to refactor some lines of code to avoid few exceptions.</p>
<p>Other than that, you can use some linting tools (ex. <code>SonarLint</code>), that will help you spot issues, check spelling and they also provide remedies.</p>
<p>There are few common exceptions that you should know, <code>OutOfMemoryException</code> , <code>NullReference</code> etc.</p>

66952039,"Hangfire - Recurring job can’t be scheduled, see inner exception for details",67257319,"<p>Turns out, Hangfire itself does not work great when multiple apps use the same <code>sql schema</code>. To solve this problem I used <a href=""https://github.com/GeXiaoguo/Hangfire.MAMQSqlExtension"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hangfire.MAMQSqlExtension</a>. It is a third-party extension but the repo says that it is officially recognized by Hangfire.
If you are using the same schema for multiple apps, you <strong>have to</strong> use this extension in <strong>all</strong> your apps, otherwise you'll face the error mentioned above.</p>
<p>If your apps have different versions alive at the same time (e.g. <em>production</em>, <em>test</em>, <em>development</em>) this app itself does not fully work for <strong>failed jobs</strong>. If a job fails, regular Hangfire will not respect it's original queue, hence will move it to the <code>default</code> queue. Which will eventually create problems if your app only works with your app's queue or if the <code>default</code> queue is shared. To solve that issue, to force Hangfire to respect the original queue attribute, I used <a href=""https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/pull/502#issuecomment-176744750"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> solution.

<p>The error indicated that it could no longer find <code>OldPropName</code> and threw the exception.</p>
<p>To quote the article on DZone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When Spring Data creates a new Repository implementation, it analyzes all the methods defined by the interfaces and tries to automatically
generate queries from the method name. While this has limitations, it
is a very powerful and elegant way of defining new custom access
methods with very little effort. For example, if the managed entity
has a name field (and the Java Bean standard getter and setter for
that field), defining the findByName method in the DAO interface will
automatically generate the correct query:</em></p>
<pre><code>public interface IFooDAO extends JpaRepository&lt; Foo, Long &gt;{
     Foo findByName( final String name );
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>This is a relatively simple example; a much larger set of keywords is supported by query creation mechanism.</em></p>
<p><em>In the case that the parser cannot match the property with the domain object field, the following exception is thrown:</em></p>

<p>This is telling you that UserService can't be created because its missing a property definition</p>

<pre><code> nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'UserDAO' defined in ServletContext resource [/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml]

<p>This tells you that the definition for UserDAO can't be found.</p>

<p>You are missing the UserDao definition, the ref just means that it should be of that type, it still needs a bean definition.</p>

<p>Basically, whenever you use ""ref"" you are telling spring to make a property of that type. That type needs to be defined in its own bean definition.</p>

<p>So if UserDao uses some other property that again is defined by a ""ref"" that property will need its own bean definition as well.</p>

<p>You have to think of the classes and the spring definitions to be two completely separate entities. The classes might be there and placed where they should, but spring needs its bean definitions in order to invoke them. It doesn't know what a UserDao or SessionFactory is unless you specifically tell it which package/class you want to be invoked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@RestController is a composed annotation that is itself meta-annotated

18813615,How to avoid the &quot;Circular view path&quot; exception with Spring MVC test,18815059,"<p>This has nothing to do with Spring MVC testing.</p>
<p>When you don't declare a <code>ViewResolver</code>, Spring registers a default <code>InternalResourceViewResolver</code> which creates instances of <code>JstlView</code> for rendering the <code>View</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>JstlView</code> class extends <code>InternalResourceView</code> which is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wrapper for a JSP or other resource within the same web application.
Exposes model objects as request attributes and forwards the request
to the specified resource URL using a javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher.</p>
<p><strong>A URL for this view is supposed to specify a resource within the web
application, suitable for RequestDispatcher's forward or include
method.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine. In other words, the view, before rendering, will try to get a <code>RequestDispatcher</code> to which to <code>forward()</code>. Before doing this it checks the following</p>
<pre><code>if (path.startsWith(&quot;/&quot;) ? uri.equals(path) : uri.equals(StringUtils.applyRelativePath(uri, path))) {
    throw new ServletException(&quot;Circular view path [&quot; + path + &quot;]: would dispatch back &quot; +
                        &quot;to the current handler URL [&quot; + uri + &quot;] again. Check your ViewResolver setup! &quot; +
                        &quot;(Hint: This may be the result of an unspecified view, due to default view name generation.)&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>path</code> is the view name, what you returned from the <code>@Controller</code>. In this example, that is <code>preference</code>. The variable <code>uri</code> holds the uri of the request being handled, which is <code>/context/preference</code>.</p>
<p>The code above realizes that if you were to forward to <code>/context/preference</code>, the same servlet (since the same handled the previous) would handle the request and you would go into an endless loop.</p>
<hr />
<p>When you declare a <code>ThymeleafViewResolver</code> and a <code>ServletContextTemplateResolver</code> with a specific <code>prefix</code> and <code>suffix</code>, it builds the <code>View</code> differently, giving it a path like</p>
<pre><code>WEB-INF/web-templates/preference.html
</code></pre>
<p><code>ThymeleafView</code> instances locate the file relative to the <code>ServletContext</code> path by using a
<code>ServletContextResourceResolver</code></p>
<pre><code>templateInputStream = resourceResolver.getResourceAsStream(templateProcessingParameters, resourceName);`
</code></pre>
<p>which eventually</p>
<pre><code>return servletContext.getResourceAsStream(resourceName);
</code></pre>
<p>This gets a resource that is relative to the <code>ServletContext</code> path. It can then use the <code>TemplateEngine</code> to generate the HTML. There's no way an endless loop can happen here.</p>

<p>I fully agree that your suggested workaround with bypassing all proxy settings by overwriting the <em>DefaultProxy</em> is legit and functional.</p>
<p>A slightly better approach would be not to hard code a 'bypass all proxy statement' in your code and use instead the <em>no_proxy</em> environment variable.
The purpose of this environment variable is to define a rule for excluding traffic destined to certain hosts</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Activate the env. variable <em>no_proxy</em> for your development setup like</p>
<p>For linux</p>
<pre><code>export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>For Dockerfile</p>

<p>For a deep dive session about  <a href=""https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/01/27/we-need-to-talk-no-proxy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proxy environment variables</a></p>
<p>It is important when you start your gRPC client application, that you check what the value of the read in environment variables is, because gRPC uses the <em>HttpClient</em> class under the hood, which considers all proxy environment variables. If the <em>no_proxy</em> value is not set, it has not effect.</p>

14029393,Exception java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException when write to client channel,76873597,"<p>I recently ran into this problem, and it was a bit of a pain to debug.
In my case, the reason was that I was creating network connection from GUI thread. Basically I just had a simple button and established websocket connection there.
This seemed innocent enough to me, as this was just supposed to be a quick test to figure out connection capabilities of my app.
What I didn't know is that Android 3.0+ explicitly forbids any networking from GUI thread, so it throws an internal exception and then the connection gets closed. Unfortunately, none of that was communicated to me by the library I used (Jetty), and because this is an async process - you just gotta know where to look.</p>

76860581,How to make clicking some elements an exception for useClickAway hook,76864956,"<p>It sounds like you want to prevent the overlay from immediately closing and reopening when the icon button is clicked, while still allowing it to close when clicking outside the overlay. Since the <code>useClickAway</code> hook triggers the <code>hideOverlay</code> function when clicking outside the overlay, you'll need a mechanism to temporarily disable this behavior when the icon button is clicked.</p>
<p>One way to achieve this is by using a flag to determine whether the overlay should be closed or not based on the last click event target. Here's an example of how you could modify your code to achieve this:</p>
<pre><code>import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import { useClickAway } from 'react-use';

const Overlay = () =&gt; {
  const overlayRef = useRef(null);
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [shouldClose, setShouldClose] = useState(true); // Add a flag

  const toggleOverlay = () =&gt; {
    setIsOpen(!isOpen);
  };

  const hideOverlay = () =&gt; {
    if (shouldClose) {
      setIsOpen(false);
    } else {
      setShouldClose(true);
    }
  };

  useClickAway(overlayRef, hideOverlay);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={toggleOverlay}&gt;Toggle Overlay&lt;/button&gt;
      {isOpen &amp;&amp; (
        &lt;div ref={overlayRef}&gt;
          {/* Overlay content */}
          &lt;button
            onClick={(e) =&gt; {
              setShouldClose(false); // Prevent closing
              e.stopPropagation();
            }}
          &gt;
            Icon Button
          &lt;/button&gt;
          {/* Other overlay content */}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      )}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default Overlay;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>shouldClose</code> flag is used to determine whether the overlay should be closed when the <code>useClickAway</code> hook triggers the <code>hideOverlay</code> function. When the icon button is clicked, the <code>shouldClose</code> flag is temporarily set to <code>false</code>, preventing the overlay from closing immediately. The <code>e.stopPropagation()</code> call prevents the event from propagating and affecting the overlay's closing behavior.</p>
<p>Remember that the above example assumes a basic overlay structure. You might need to adapt it to fit your specific code and styling.</p>

45466040,Verify that an exception is thrown using Mocha / Chai and async/await,45496509,"<p>The problem with this approach is that <code>(await fails()).should.throw(Error)</code> doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><code>await</code> resolves a <code>Promise</code>. If the <code>Promise</code> rejects, it throws the rejected value.</p>
<p>So <code>(await fails()).should.throw(Error)</code> can never work: if <code>fails()</code> rejects, an error is thrown, and <code>.should.throw(Error)</code> is never executed.</p>
<p>The most idiomatic option you have is to use Chai's <code>rejectedWith</code> property, as you have shown in your question.</p>
<p>Here's a quick example. Not much is different from what you've demonstrated in your question; I'm just using <code>async</code> functions for <code>wins()</code> and <code>fails()</code> and <code>expect</code> instead of <code>should</code>. Of course, you can use functions that return a <code>Promise</code> and <code>chai.should</code> just fine.</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>const chai = require('chai')
const expect = chai.expect
chai.use(require('chai-as-promised'))

// Always succeeds
async function wins() {
  return 'Winner'
}

// Always fails with an error
async function fails() {
  throw new Error('Contrived Error')
}

it('wins() returns Winner', async () =&gt; {
  expect(await wins()).to.equal('Winner')
})

it('fails() throws Error', async () =&gt; {
  await expect(fails()).to.be.rejectedWith(Error)
})
</code></pre>
<p>If you like want your <code>wins()</code> test to resemble your <code>fails()</code> test more closely, you can write your <code>wins()</code> test like so:</p>
<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>it('wins() returns Winner', async () =&gt; {
  await expect(wins()).to.eventually.equal('Winner')
})
</code></pre>
<p>The key thing to remember in either of these examples is that <code>chai-as-promised</code> returns promises for its functions such as <code>rejectedWith</code> and <code>eventually.something</code>. Therefore you must <code>await</code> them in the context of an <code>async</code> test function, or else failing conditions will still pass:</p>
<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>async function wins() {
  return 'Loser'
}

async function fails() {
  return 'Winner'
}

it('wins() returns Winner', async () =&gt; {
  expect(wins()).to.eventually.equal('Winner')
})

it('fails() throws Error', async () =&gt; {
  expect(fails()).to.be.rejectedWith(Error)
})
</code></pre>
<p>If you ran the tests with the code above, you'd get the following:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>$ npm test

&gt; mocha-chai-async@1.0.0 test /home/adaline/code/mocha-chai-async
&gt; mocha .



  √ wins() returns Winner
(node:13836) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rej

 it was fulfilled with 'Winner'

  2 passing (11ms)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the chai assertions actually failed, but they were failed in the context of a Promise that no one ever <code>await</code>ed or <code>catch</code>ed. So Mocha sees no failure and marks the tests as though they passed, but Node.js (in behaviour that will change in the future as noted above) prints the unhandled rejections to the terminal.</p>

<p>This was a problem of the <code>@angular/cli</code>. Updating the version to <code>&gt;= 8.3.22</code> should fix the issue: <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16515#issuecomment-572625203"" rel=""noreferrer"">see this comment in #16515</a></p>

<h3>ORIGINAL</h3>

<p>Basically the build process is running out of memory: see related angular-cli issues <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15493"" rel=""noreferrer"">#15493</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16515"" rel=""noreferrer"">#16515</a></p>

<p>The recommended remedy is to:   </p>

<ul>
<li>update node to the latest version e.g. <code>12.14.0</code></li>
<li><strong>increase</strong> the <strong>memory</strong> for the build process: 

<ul>
<li>in your <code>package.json</code> change the <code>""build""</code> script to: <code>node --max_old_space_size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build</code></li>
<li>in this case the memory is increased to <code>4GB</code><br>
depending on the size of your project you may need more</li>
</ul></li>

<p>As a quick <strong>workaround</strong> it could also work to use older versions of <code>angular/cli</code> and <code>build-angular</code>: </p>

<p>Another workaround is to disable <a href=""https://angular.io/guide/deployment#differential-loading"" rel=""noreferrer"">differential-loading</a> (i.e. skip generation of ES5 bundles), if you want this. Then the build-process will need less memory and may work.</p>

<p>I was initialising <code>ScopedModel</code> inside <code>main()</code> and inside that I was awaiting for some data.</p>

<p>There is a very small fix.
Just run <code>WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()</code> inside <code>void main()</code> , before you do <code>runApp()</code>. Works like a charm!!</p>

<p>As a result, we need to manually change the code as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>If you're running an application and need to access the binary messenger before <code>runApp()</code> has been called (for example, during
  plugin initialization), then you need to explicitly call the 
  <code>WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()</code> first.</li>
  <li>If you're running a test, you can call the <code>TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()</code> as the first line in
  your test's <code>main()</code> method to initialize the binding.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, if you are a newbie like me and struggling to understand the above and <a href=""https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/38464"" rel=""noreferrer"">#38464</a>, you can temporarily avoid this problem by switching to the beta channel.

<p>Coming to your question, now. If you want to create a custom Exception, just extend Exception class like:</p>

<p>and throw it like:</p>

<p>You don't actually need four constructors. You only need two to match the base Exception class's four:</p>
<pre><code>class CustomException(message: String? = null, cause: Throwable? = null) : Exception(message, cause) {
    constructor(cause: Throwable) : this(null, cause)
}

<p>The Exception base class comes from the Java standard library, and Java doesn't have default parameters, so the Java class must have four constructors for every combination of acceptable inputs. Furthermore, both <code>message</code> and <code>cause</code> are allowed to be <code>null</code> in Exception, so ours should be, too, if we're trying to be 100% compatible with Exception.</p>
<p>The only reason we even <em>need</em> the second constructor is to avoid needing to use named argument syntax in Kotlin code: <code>CustomException(cause = fooThrowable)</code> vs <code>Exception(fooThrowable)</code>.</p>

<p>This clearly states that in the class <code>DemandLedgerMap</code> you are trying to persist demandLedger, which is a non-nullable field.
So when you are using <code>dcbDailyBalanceService.quartsTestdDisplay();</code> you are not providing the value for this.</p>

76647772,When should I throw exception vs. return error ActionResult in ASP.NET Core Web API project?,76647919,"<p>you can return <code>IActionResult </code> as you are already returning <code>NotFoundObjectResult</code> from other places in your project. It's cleaner and simple as well, So no need to throw/catch exceptions. With this approach, It is easier to unit test as well. It will be helpful when implementing a middleware around <code>IActionResult </code>.</p>
<p>Throwing exceptions has an advantage if you have logic to manage resources separate from the controller which will also fulfil the separation of concern. You can have a centralized place to maintain the exceptions in middleware or a custom exception filter. Throwing exceptions makes the app slow, this can be avoided if it's very very less.</p>
<p>Both approaches have pros and cons. so ultimately it depends on your requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>This is the continuation of my answer, as OP asked about the general design principles, so extending my answer. Hope it is able to help.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong>: A class should only have one responsibility. In your case, the <code>UserManagementService</code> should only be responsible for managing users. If you throw an exception, the service is only responsible for handling the error, which is a separate responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: Throwing an exception keeps the service decoupled from the HTTP-specific abstractions and concerns. This means that the service can be used in different contexts, such as non-web scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Principle of Least Astonishment</strong>: Returning an <code>IActionResult</code> might be more intuitive for other developers working with your codebase, as it aligns with the conventions and patterns established in ASP.NET Core. However, if you provide clear documentation and guidelines on how the service works, throwing an exception can also be a reasonable approach.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Considerations</strong>: Throwing an exception incurs a performance overhead compared to returning a simple object, as it involves stack unwinding and exception handling mechanisms. If performance is a crucial factor and the resource not found scenario is expected to occur frequently, returning an error result might be a better choice.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Consider the existing conventions and patterns in your codebase. If other components or services in your project consistently use exceptions for error handling, it would be more consistent to follow the same approach throughout the codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Code Reusability</strong>: If you plan to reuse the <code>UserManagementService</code> in other projects or scenarios where ASP.NET Core is not the underlying framework, throwing an exception might be a better choice. It keeps the service decoupled from the framework-specific abstractions, making it more reusable.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling Strategy</strong>: Establish a consistent error-handling strategy throughout your project. If the project predominantly handles errors through exceptions and has a global exception handler, throwing a custom exception would align with the existing strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, if you prioritize separation of concerns, code reusability, and adherence to SRP, throwing a custom exception like <code>MyNotFoundException</code> would be a suitable approach. On the other hand, if performance is a significant concern and aligning with ASP.NET Core conventions is more important, returning an <code>IActionResult</code> might be a better choice.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best approach depends on your specific project and requirements. You should consider the trade-offs and choose the approach that best fits your project's needs and aligns with the project's existing design and conventions.</p>

<p>When should I throw exception vs. return error ActionResult in ASP.NET Core Web API project?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rule of thumb that I have established in recent years is that exceptions should be thrown only in truly exceptional situations (i.e. resulting in the 500 Internal Server Error, and in general servers should not return 500s). There are several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The main point being that other usages can be considered as the infamous &quot;exceptions as control flow&quot; which is generally considered as antipattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/729379/2501279"">Why not use exceptions as regular flow of control?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/189222/365370"">Are exceptions as control flow considered a serious antipattern? If so, Why?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://wiki.c2.com/?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Don't Use Exceptions For Flow Control</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You can't expose the exceptions in method contracts (in .NET), so you should always be aware about actual implementations (which affects the reusability of the code outside of ASP.NET environment).</p>
</li>
<li><p>As you mentioned being performance (though it is rarely a deciding factor because rarely exceptions overhead is that significant).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, if service returns <code>IActionResult</code> from the operation, it makes things faster in case of an error but it couples service with ASP.NET Core types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you should not return <code>IActionResult</code> from services, there are multiple options for return types which are better, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nullable <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reference</a>/<a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">value types</a> (I find myself often using pattern when service/repository/query has <code>FindSomething</code> method which returns nullable type which is mapped into <code>NotFoundResult</code> in the controller)</li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/altmann/FluentResults"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>FluentResults</code></a></li>
<li>Functional style <a href=""https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Core/Monads/Alternative%20Value%20Monads/Either/Either/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Either</code></a>/<code>Maybe</code> monads for example from <a href=""https://github.com/louthy/language-ext"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C# Functional Programming Language Extensions</a> or from <a href=""https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CSharpFunctionalExtensions</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/mcintyre321/OneOf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>OneOf</code></a></li>
<li>Even <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">value tuples</a> (though would not be the best option here)</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic idea being that you get the result and map it into response (possibly using some kind of chained fluent calls like <code>MapSuccess</code> if you don't want multiple <code>if-else</code>s or <code>if-return</code>s). TBH I have not found ideal one for me which would easily cover all cases but still prefer this to throwing/catching exceptions which can quickly can become cumbersome with multiple catch blocks.</p>
"
76647772,When should I throw exception vs. return error ActionResult in ASP.NET Core Web API project?,76724669,"<p>There are multiple possible solutions, which depend on the developer's preferences. I thought I would post an opinionated answer on the end-to-end behavior I prefer. It is focused on good supportability in APIs, and enabling the following qualities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Useful API logs, to enable effective queries</li>
<li>Useful client errors</li>
<li>Separation of concerns</li>
<li>Clean API code</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4xx SERIES ERRORS</strong></p>
<p>In the service class I would write code similar to this. In relation to your question, throwing an exception can lend itself better to logging of 4xx requests:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class UserManagementService : IUserManagementService
{
    public Task&lt;UserResult&gt; DeleteUser(string id)
    {
        var user = await _dbContext.Users.FindAsync(id);
        if (user == null)
        {
            var extraContext = &quot;Some server side context&quot;;
            throw ErrorFactory.ClientError(
                404,
                &quot;user_not_found&quot;,
                &quot;Invalid delete user operation&quot;,
                extraContext);
        }

        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I would not use exceptions as general flow control. Instead, this is throwing an exception at the point where the API has decided to return a client error response. By doing so, you collect the most useful context at the point where the information is available. This context is then available to logs, and only simple code is required.</p>
<p>Deleting a user with an invalid ID is not expected to be a common occurrence, so performance will be good enough. The service class runs business logic and does not use types from the hosting technology. Here I am using an <code>error code</code> to represent distinct causes of problems.</p>
<p>The exception would be processed by logging and exception middleware. If you don't like the REST status code in the above error object you could instead map from error codes to statuses in middleware classes.</p>
<p>The client would then receive a response with status 404 and a payload I could control, such as the following. In some cases, error codes can inform clients of specific types of error, so that the client can take a compensating action.</p>
<pre class=""lang-json prettyprint-override""><code>{
  &quot;code&quot;: &quot;user_not_found&quot;,
  &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Invalid delete user operation&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Meanwhile, the API could write a log entry such as the following, then ship this data to a log aggregation system:</p>
<pre class=""lang-json prettyprint-override""><code>{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;7af62b06-8c04-41b0-c428-de332436d52a&quot;,
  &quot;utcTime&quot;: &quot;2023-07-24T10:27:33.468Z&quot;,
  &quot;apiName&quot;: &quot;Users&quot;,
  &quot;operationName&quot;: &quot;deleteUser&quot;,
  &quot;hostName&quot;: &quot;somehost&quot;,
  &quot;method&quot;: &quot;DELETE&quot;,
  &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/users&quot;,
  &quot;resourceId&quot;: &quot;22&quot;,
  &quot;clientApplicationName&quot;: &quot;MobileApp&quot;,
  &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;a6b404b1-98af-41a2-8e7f-e4061dc0bf86&quot;,
  &quot;statusCode&quot;: 404,
  &quot;errorCode&quot;: &quot;user_not_found&quot;,
  &quot;correlationId&quot;: &quot;15b030a2-c67d-01ae-7c3f-237b9a70dbba&quot;,
  &quot;sessionId&quot;: &quot;77136323-ec8c-dce2-147a-bc52f34cb7cd&quot;,
  &quot;errorData&quot;: {
    &quot;statusCode&quot;: 404,
    &quot;context&quot;: &quot;Some server side context&quot;,
    &quot;clientError&quot;: {
      &quot;code&quot;: &quot;user_not_found&quot;,
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Invalid delete user operation&quot;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You could query the log aggregation system to see how often this type of error was happening. Use of error codes enables the frequency of each type of error to be measured:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>select * from apilogs where apiName='Users' and operationName='deleteUser' and error_code='user_not_found';
</code></pre>
<p><strong>5xx SERIES ERRORS</strong></p>
<p>For other types of error you will need to return a 500 error to the client:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class UserManagementService : IUserManagementService
{
    public Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteUser(string id)
    {
        try
        {            
            var user = await _dbContext.Users.FindAsync(id);
            ...
        } 
        catch(SomeDbException ex)
        {
            var extraContext = &quot;Some server side context&quot;;
            throw ErrorFactory.ServerError(
                &quot;data_access_error&quot;, 
                &quot;Problem encountered during data access&quot;,
                ex,
                errorContext);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The exception would again be processed by logging and exception middleware. The client would receive a response with status 500 and a different payload. This can include a unique ID for the error occurrence. The client might then render a screen with the ID and time details. These could be reported by end users to your technical support staff.</p>
<pre class=""lang-json prettyprint-override""><code>{
    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;data_access_error&quot;,
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Problem encountered during data access&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 88146,
    &quot;utcTime&quot;: &quot;2023-07-06T12:42:30.357Z&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The API would write a log entry such as this, which would again end up in a log aggregation system:</p>
<pre class=""lang-json prettyprint-override""><code>{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;7af62b06-8c04-41b0-c428-de332436d52a&quot;,

      &quot;stack&quot;: &quot;at System.Data.SqlClient.ExecuteCommand ...&quot;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When such an error was reported, technical support staff would be able to look up the technical details associated to the error, using only the ID. With solid API logs, this would enable the problem to be understood and resolved quickly in many cases.</p>
<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>select * from apilogs where error_id=88146;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Although there are many possible ways to deal with errors in APIs, I like to think behavior through in terms of end-to-end supportability. I have had a success with this type of logging when doing onsite support for financial systems. It also works well in larger development setups, when APIs are integrated across teams.</p>
<p>Once code is set up in this way, an organization is in a good position to deal with any intermittent (4xx or 5xx) errors that are causing problems for API clients. It requires some investment to get the above type of end-to-end flow working though. Out of interest, my <a href=""https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.apisample.netcore"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example OAuth .NET API</a> provides this type of behaviour, in case useful.</p>

<p>For example:
Instead of an ExceptionHelper you could have an ActionRunner.</p>

<pre><code>public class ActionRunner
{
    public Action AttemptAction { get; set; }
    public Action SuccessfulAction { get; set; }
    public Action ExceptionAction { get; set; }

    public void RunAction()

<p>What happens when you run your code through localhost:
when you run your wcf test client from localhost, it will be able to communicate to database as local debug mode application is calling database by your account's service. So it has access to database because devenv.exe is running under your user account.</p>

<p>But when you deploy your web service in IIS. Now understand this service runs under IIS not under your account. So you need to assign access rights to IIS service to access the sql server for windows authentication.
Here your web service would not be able to communicate to the SQL server because of access rights issue.</p>

<p>So if you are using windows authentication to connect your database, you just have to change the IIS Application pool settings.
You need to change IIS Application pool's identity to local System.</p>

<p>Below are the Steps for windows authentication WCF: 
•Open IIS (windows+R (run) then type inetmgr, then click ok)
•double click your PC name under Connections 
•Click Application Pools 
•Select your app pool (DefaultAppPool) 
•Then under actions on the right click Advanced Settings:
•Go to Process Model section and 
•click on Identity. 
•Now select LocalSystem.</p>

<p>Now open your sql server management studio:
open run-> then type ssms then press ok
in ssms, login using your windows authentication account.
open security tab
expand logins tab
then you will be able to view your account.</p>

<p>Now open properties of your account
go to userMapping
then select the database you want to connect
then check the role membership services you want to use for the selected database
click ok.</p>

<p>add Trusted_Connection=True; property in your connection string.
Save it &amp; deploy the web service.

17414148,Multiple catch statements with the same exception types,17414465,"<p>A general principle of exceptions is that they are handled at the point they are best abled to  be handled.</p>

<p>You seem to have very disparate exceptions and presumably a TCP exception thrown somewhere in the code is not the same as the SQLException thrown when connecting to a database (I might be wrong here since I don't know what the rest of the code looks like). So would not a set of exception handlers, one for each type make more sense. Also to reite from Bryan Roach, text disambiguation is not a good idea.</p>

<pre><code>try {
...
} catch (java.net.SocketException e) {
 e[0] = ""tcp error"";
} catch (java.sql.SQLException e) {
 e[1] = ""sql exception happened"";

<pre><code>ArrayList errors = new ArrayList();
errors.add(""Some tcp error"");
errors.add(""Some db error"");

<pre><code>mGUI.reportErrors(errors.toArray())
</code></pre>

<p>would preserve your interface and not waste you having to allocate extra elements to the array and have empty entries. I don't know exactly what your question is, but you allude to the GUI not displaying multiple errors. Possibly there is a check which stops at the first empty element in an array. Say e[2] and e[4] is populated, it might stop when it iterates over the errors as e[3] is empty. I'm presuming again since I don't know what that code looks like</p>
"
17414148,Multiple catch statements with the same exception types,17417666,"<p>From the comments above it sounds like what you want to do is have different logic for the various Exception types you are catching within a single catch block. If this is the case, you could go:</p>

<pre><code>...
catch(ClassNotFoundException | SQLException e) {
    String[] errors = new String[4];
    if (e instanceof ClassNotFoundException) {

<p>I don't mean any offense, but the way the code handles exceptions might cause some headaches down the road. For example:</p>

<pre><code>if (e.getMessage().startsWith(""Cannot open database"")) {

<p>Here the code relies on the supporting library that throws the exception to use the same text description, but this description might change if you switch to another JVM version,  use a different database driver, etc. It might be safer to go by the exception type, rather than the exception description.</p>

<li>The <strong>render</strong> method is responsible for converting a given exception into an HTTP response that should be sent back to the browser.

27896613,ContinueWith TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted does not seem to catch an exception thrown from a started task,27912507,"<p>First of all, you aren't using <code>OnlyOnFaulted</code> correctly. When you use <code>ContinueWith</code> on a task, you don't really change that task, <strong>you get back a task continuation</strong> (which, in your case, you disregard).</p>
<p>If the original task faulted (i.e., had an exception thrown inside it) <strong>it would stay faulted</strong> (so calling <code>Wait()</code> on it would always rethrow the exception). The continuation, however, would run after the task is faulted and handle the exception.</p>
<p>That means that in your code, you do handle the exception, but you're also rethrowing it with <code>Wait()</code>. The correct code should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Task originalTask = Task.Run(() =&gt; throw new Exception());
Task continuationTask = originalTask.ContinueWith(
    t =&gt; Console.WriteLine(t.Exception), 
    TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted);

continuationTask.Wait();
// Both tasks completed. No exception rethrown

<p>Now, as Yuval Itzchakov pointed out, you can handle the exception wherever you want, but it would be better if you were utilizing <code>async-await</code> to wait asynchronously if you can (you can't in <code>Main</code>) instead of blocking with <code>Wait()</code>:</p>

  <p>Am I using the <code>TaskContinutationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted</code> correctly or is it always better to

</blockquote>

<p>You can handle exceptions either way, inside or outside. It's a matter of preference and usually depends on the use-case.</p>

<p>Note that one thing you aren't doing is keeping a reference to your continuation. You're using <code>Task.Wait</code> on the original task which propogates the exception regardless of the fact that you have a continuation which handles it.</p>

<p>One thing that bothers me is that you're using <code>Task.Wait</code> which <em>synchronously waits</em> instead of <code>await</code> which <em>asynchronously waits</em>. Thats the reason for the <code>AggregationException</code>. More so, you shouldn't block on asynchronous operations, as that will lead you down a rabit hole you probably don't want to go, with all sorts of synchronization context problems.</p>

<p>What i would personally do, is use <code>await</code> inside of <code>ContinueWith</code>, because its the less verbose option. Also, i'd use <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2011/10/24/10229468.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Task.Run over Task.Factory.StartNew</a>:</p>

What if we do not want to use a separate thread? If we want to simply start a task, running it synchronously until we hit IO or a delay, and then continue about our own business. Only at the very end, we will wait for the task to complete.</p>

<p>How do we await the task with rethrowing its exception? Instead of wrapping it in <code>Task.Run()</code>, we will use an empty continuation that will always succeed when the task finishes for any reason.</p>

<pre><code>// Local function that waits a moment before throwing
async Task ThrowInAMoment()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    Console.WriteLine(""Task waited for a sec"");
    throw new Exception(""Throwing for example"");

// We reach this line as soon as ThrowInAMoment() can no longer proceed synchronously
// This is as soon as it hits its ""await Delay(1000)""

// Handle exceptions in the task

<p>That being said, the problem is most likely a mismatch between the version the bytecode output by <code>solc</code> and the version of the bytecode supported by the EVM that you are deploying to.</p>
<p>Note that opcodes are not static, and they may be added or removed by means of EIPs (agreed upon by the Ethereum community). See the full list to date here: <a href=""https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/150094/48984"">&quot;When did each opcode get added to the EVM?&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>Your smart contract specifies this version of <code>solc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pragma solidity &gt;=0.7.0 &lt;0.9.0;
</code></pre>
<p>... which means a wide range of versions can be used.
Narrow this down by specifying a specific version.
The latest version of <code>solc</code> which I consider to be production-ready is <code>0.8.17</code>,
and by that I mean supported by most developer tools, frameworks, etc.;
plus EVM implementations.</p>
<p>So change this statement to:</p>
<pre><code>pragma solidity 0.8.17;

<p>Next, install and use that version of <code>solc</code>, then compile your smart con tract with it:</p>

27890597,Unhandled Exception in Java,27890631,"<p>What do you mean ""return"" an exception? When an exception is thrown, it bubbles up the call stack.</p>

<p>You are not handling it in this case. It reaches <code>main</code> and thus you have an unhandled exception.</p>

<p>If you want to handle an exception, you'd use a <code>try-catch</code> block. Preferably surrounding <code>main</code> in this case.</p>

<pre><code>try {
    // Code that might throw
    // an exception.
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle it.
}

<p>Another solution would be to specify that <code>main</code> throws a ""<code>RandomWeirdException</code>"", and not <code>catch</code> it in the first place.</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws RandomWeirdException { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>It's preferable to just let functions <code>throw</code>, unless you can reasonably handle the exceptional case.
If you just <code>catch</code> for the sake of catching without doing anything meaningful in an exceptional case, it's the equivalent of hiding an error sometimes.</p>
"
27890597,Unhandled Exception in Java,27890658,"<p>You are using the <code>execute</code> method, without creating a try-catch block for the <code>RandomWiredException</code> which it declares that it is throwing. Java required all checked exceptions (that extend <code>Exception</code>) to be properly handled by the caller - either with a try-catch block, or by adding <code>throws</code> to the calling method (in this case, it is <code>main</code>, though, so it shouldn't have a <code>throws</code> clause).</p>

<p>So the proper way to do it is like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double x=Math.random();

<p>When you install the assembly to GAC, you need to <a href=""https://winscp.net/eng/docs/library_install#installing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">configure a path to WinSCP executable</a>.</p>

<p>Windows SDK comes with Microsoft Visual Studio. You can also install it separately.</p>
<p>Use correct <code>gacutil.exe</code> for your version of .NET framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>For .NET framework 4.0 or newer, use <code>gacutil</code> from Windows SDK 7.1 (or newer):<br />
<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\bin\gacutil.exe</code>;</li>
<li>For .NET framework 3.5, use <code>gacutil</code> from Windows SDK 6.0:<br />
<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Bin\gacutil.exe</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Production or User's Machine</strong></p>
<p>To install the assembly into GAC on production or user’s machine, you may install the assembly into GAC using:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Windows Installer, by creating <code>.msi</code> package;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any other installer system that supports installing to GAC, e.g. <a href=""https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Inno Setup</a>;</p>

<p>As 'Günter Zöchbauer' describes, it is not possible to use directives in host bindings. And he comes with a solution for ngClass.</p>

<p><strong>button.ts</strong></p>

import {NgStyle} from ""angular2/common"";

@Component({
    selector: 'button',
    host: {

export class Button {
    styleAsString() {

        };

        return JSON.stringify(style).replace('{', '').replace('}', '').replace(/""/g, '');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note, that this is not a perfect solution because it lacks while 'compiling' the object to plain css. I simply replace all occurences of ' "" ' which results in an odd behaviour when using 'url("" ""), ...'. 
Hope that i could help somebody with the same or a similar question.</p>

46630900,Unsatisfied Dependency Exception in creating beans using Spring,46640989,"<p>It is not an answer, however I cannot add a comment yet. </p>

<p>Did you try to autowire a ServletContext via setter method?
- remove @Autowired from property
- remove one of your setters for context (unnecessary duplication)
- mark a setter as @Autowired</p>

<p>Moreover remove @Component annotation from MyService, it is unnecessary if you are using @Service annotation in its implementation.</p>
"
46630900,Unsatisfied Dependency Exception in creating beans using Spring,46643575,"<p>As per Apache Tomcat documentation, a <code>ServletContext</code> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Defines a set of methods that a servlet uses to communicate with its
  servlet container. </p>
  
  <p>There is one context per ""web application"" per Java Virtual Machine.
  (A ""web application"" is a collection of servlets and content installed
  under a specific subset of the server's URL namespace such as /catalog
  and possibly installed via a .war file.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means that a ServletContext is only valid within a Servlet Container like Apache Tomcat. But as I can see, you are trying to run a normal Java application by creating beans in a main method, which makes the existence of <code>ServletContext</code> invalid.</p>

<p>So what you have to do is:</p>

<p>STEP 1: Build your AppConfig and override required methods.</p>

<pre><code>@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {""net.bb.spring""})
public class AppConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {

        @Override
        public void configureDefaultServletHandling(DefaultServletHandlerConfigurer configurer) {
            configurer.enable();
        }

        @Override
        public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
            registry.addResourceHandler(""/resources/**"").addResourceLocations(""/WEB-INF/"");
        }
        //....
    }
</code></pre>

<p>STEP 2: Create WebInitializer to initialize Dispatcher Servlet</p>

<pre><code>public class WebInitializer extends AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer {

    @Override
    protected Class&lt;?&gt;[] getRootConfigClasses() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    protected Class&lt;?&gt;[] getServletConfigClasses() {
        return new Class&lt;?&gt;[] {AppConfig.class};
    }

    @Override
    protected String[] getServletMappings() {
        return new String[] {""/""};
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>STEP 3: Create your Service layer to autowire ServletContext</p>

<pre><code>@Service
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    private ServletContext servletContext;

    @Autowire
    public MyServiceImpl(ServletContext servletContext) {
        this.servletContext = servletContext;
    }

    public ServletContext getServletContext() {
        return servletContext;
    }

    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>STEP 6: Start Tomcat</p>

46630900,Unsatisfied Dependency Exception in creating beans using Spring,56727895,"<p>Here is what you need to change:</p>

<p>The problem is that with JDBC you can't pass an array of two values <code>(""1165006001"",""1165006002"")</code>into the query </p>

<pre><code>select * from SOA_WEB_USER.VOPEX where CMF_PPK_NBR in (?)

</code></pre>

<p>as it seems to me you want it to.</p>

<p>If you could pass the array in, the query would return all rows for which the column <code>CMF_PPK_NBR</code> contained a nested table with those two values.  Oracle would interpret the array as one value, rather than two.  I'm guessing that column has type either <code>VARCHAR2</code>, and so you'd only end up with a type error as Oracle tries to compare an array of strings to a single string.</p>

<p>If you want to pass multiple values in an <code>IN</code> clause, then the simplest way is to build up a SQL string with a number of <code>?</code> marks, and set values for the parameters individually.  In other words, for the example above, the SQL string for two parameters would be</p>

<pre><code>select * from SOA_WEB_USER.VOPEX where CMF_PPK_NBR in (?, ?)
</code></pre>

<p>and you would have two calls to <code>prep.setString(...)</code>, one for each array element.  Similarly, if there were, say, 5 items in the array, you'd build a SQL string with 5 <code>?</code> marks, and call <code>prep.setString(...)</code> 5 times, and so on.</p>

<h3>Use a hand-crafted <code>in (?,...)</code> clause.</h3>

<p>The <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/3107059/223424"">solution is explained here</a>. The idea is to add as many <code>?</code>s as threre are array elements, and bind each item individually. This gives you safety of mind because values will be properly translated, escaped, etc.</p>

<p>This sort of defeats the purpose of preparing a statement, unless your arrays are normally the same size.</p>

<p>You can also run out of the allowed query length if you have great many items in the array.</p>

<pre><code>...in (select cast(in_list(?) as some_table_type) from dual)
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter here is passed as <code>varchar2</code>, like <code>""1, 2, 3""</code>, is parsed as an in-memory table, and is selected from, all inside the <code>in</code> clause.</p>

<p>This allows you to have a query of a fixed length, and possibly efficiently reuse the prepared statement. It also allows you to pass great many items in the array. </p>

<p>It, OTOH, <em>requires you to concatenate and pass the data as a string,</em> which can potentially lead to an <em>SQL injection.</em> I'd still suppose it to be safe if your array values are numeric. </p>

<p>The stylesheet uses <code>xsl:function</code>, and specifies version=&quot;2.0&quot;, but is being run using an XSLT 1.0 processor. According to the rules of XSLT 1.0, if the version is greater than 1.0, then it runs in &quot;forwards compatibility mode&quot; (FCM). In FCM, any top-level declarations not defined in XSLT 1.0 are ignored; so the <code>xsl:function</code> declaration has no effect, it is simply ignored. So how does Xalan handle the function call <code>mytag:isTheRightElement(@class)</code>? It's not a call to a built-in function, so the only thing it can be is a call to a (Java) extension function. So Xalan tries to interpret it as a call-out to Java, and fails, because, as it says &quot;The first argument ... is not a valid object reference&quot;.</p>
<p>Yes, it's an error message that doesn't get anywhere near the real cause of the problem. Standing back a bit, when you design error messages, you've got to try and work out what the user was trying to do. Xalan thinks the user was trying to call out to Java, and it was wrong. But how could the designers of Xalan, years before XSLT 2.0 was specified, have guessed the true reason?</p>
<p>FCM has not been the most successful feature of XSLT's design. The idea (at a time when people assumed XSLT would be widely used in the browser, and that lots of users would be using rather old browsers) was that if you pointed an old browser that only supported XSLT 1.0 at a web site that used a more up-to-date version, then you would get some kind of sensible fallback behaviour. But as this example shows, simply ignoring the <code>xsl:function</code> declaration doesn't stop the stylesheet failing, and it would have given a clearer error message if the <code>xsl:function</code> declaration had simply been rejected as invalid. Predicting the future is not easy.</p>

<ul>
<li>how <strong>sure</strong> are you that the value is there?</li>
<li>how do you want to <strong>react</strong> if it isn't?</li>
</ul>

<p>If at that point in your code you <strong>expect</strong> the value to be there, and in the remote case that it isn't you want your program to <strong>fail</strong> fast, then I would only do a normal <code>get</code> and let Scala throw a <code>NoSuchElementException</code> if there was no value:</p>

<pre class=""lang-scala prettyprint-override"">

  x match {
    case Some(value) => value
    case None => throw new MyRuntimeException(""blah"")

16263560,Get Option value or throw an exception,35736191,"<p>I hope this will help you to understand how to represent errors (and generally effects) using types.</p>
<h3>Error handling strategies in functional Scala</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <code>Option</code> to return optional values. <em>For example</em> - fail to find entity in storage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <code>Option(possiblyNull)</code> to avoid instances of <code>Some(null)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use <code>Either[Error, T]</code> to report expected failure.</strong> <em>For example</em> - email format is wrong, cannot parse a string to a number, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Model your errors as <a href=""https://nrinaudo.github.io/scala-best-practices/definitions/adt.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ADTs</a> (simply speaking kind of type hierarchies) to use it, for example, on the Left of the Either to represent more complex error scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Throw <code>Exception</code> only to signal unexpected and not-recoverable failures.</strong> Like missing config file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <code>Either.catchOnly</code> or <code>Try</code> or <a href=""https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/io.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Cats.IO</code></a> (advanced) rather than a catch block for handling unexpected failures. Hint: You can still use ADT but <a href=""https://nrinaudo.github.io/scala-best-practices/adts/errors_extend_exception.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">extend them</a> from throwables. More about <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/29779352/2453144""><code>Either</code> vs <code>Try</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <a href=""https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/validated.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Validated</code></a> data-type from Cats lib to accumulate errors rather than fail-fast (<code>Either</code>), but prefer Either's on module-level to simplify the composition of the program (to have the same types). <em>For example</em> - form data validation, parsing errors accumulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use mentioned types and don't optimize program preemptively</strong> - since most probably, bottle-necks would be in business logic, not in effect types.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Such an approach will simplify maintenance and updates of your code since you can reason about it without going to implementation specifics (aka local-reasoning). Also - reduce bugs - you cannot miss an error in the type. And compose the program easier (with help of <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code> and other combinators) - since it's simpler on type level, rather than with non-local exceptions and side-effects.<br />
<a href=""https://github.com/kell18/head-first-scala/blob/master/src/main/resources/resources.md"" rel=""noreferrer"">More</a> about learning functional Scala.</p>
<hr />
<p>But be aware that sometimes with this approach types could stack up and it could become harder to compose things. Given, for example: <code>x: Future[Either[Error, Option[T]]]</code> What you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>map</code> and <code>flatMap</code> in combination with pattern-matching to compose different values of such types, for example:</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""lang-scala prettyprint-override""><code>x.faltMap { case Right(Some(v)) =&gt; anotherFuture(v); case Left(er) =&gt; ... }
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If it doesn't help you can try to use <a href=""https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/eithert.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">MonadTransformers</a> (don't be scared of the name, it's just wrappers around the effect types like Either and Future)</li>
<li>Also, an option is to simplify your errors ADT by <a href=""https://nrinaudo.github.io/scala-best-practices/adts/errors_extend_exception.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">extending them</a> from the Throwable to unify it with Future, then it'll be <code>Future[Option[T]]</code></li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr />
<p>And finally, in your case one option will be:</p>
<pre><code>def foo() : Either[Error, String] = {
    val x : Option[String] = ...
    x match {
        case Some(v) =&gt; Right(v)
        case None =&gt; Left(Error(reason))

"
348833,How to know the exact line of code where an exception has been caused?,348930,"<p>There are several possibilities to find out where the exception was thrown:</p>

<p><strong>Using compiler macros</strong></p>

<p>Using <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code> macros at throw location (as already shown by other commenters), either by using them in std exceptions as text, or as separate arguments to a custom exception:</p>

<p>Either use</p>

<pre><code>throw std::runtime_error(msg "" at "" `__FILE__` "":"" `__LINE__`);

<p>or throw</p>

<pre><code>class my_custom_exception {
  my_custom_exception(const char* msg, const char* file, unsigned int line)

<p>Note that even when compiling for Unicode (in Visual Studio), <strong>FILE</strong> expands to a single-byte string.
 This works in debug and release. Unfortunately, source file names with code throwing exceptions are placed in the output executable.</p>

<p><strong>Stack Walking</strong></p>

<p>Find out exception location by walking the call stack.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On Linux with gcc the functions backtrace() and backtrace_symbols() can get infos about the current call stack. See the <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Backtraces.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">gcc documentation</a> how to use them. The code must be compiled with -g, so that debug symbols are placed in the executable.</p></li>
<li><p>On Windows, you can walk the stack using the dbghelp library and its function StackWalk64. See Jochen Kalmbach's <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/threads/StackWalker.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">article</a> on CodeProject for details. This works in debug and release, and you need to ship .pdb files for all modules you want infos about.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can even combine the two solutions by collecting call stack info when a custom exception is thrown. The call stack can be stored in the exception, just like in .NET or Java. Note that collecting call stack on Win32 is very slow (my latest test showed about 6 collected call stacks per second). If your code throws many exceptions, this approach slows down your program considerably.</p>

Not all of them do though.</p>

<p>Notably,<code>EnvironmentError</code> (with subclasses <code>IOError</code> and <code>OSError</code>) has a first argument of <code>errno</code>, second of <code>strerror</code>. There is no <code>message</code>... <code>strerror</code> is roughly analogous to what would normally be a <code>message</code>.</p>

<p>More generally, subclasses of <code>Exception</code> can do whatever they want. They may or may not have a <code>message</code> attribute. Future built-in <code>Exception</code>s may not have a <code>message</code> attribute. Any <code>Exception</code> subclass imported from third-party libraries or user code may not have a <code>message</code> attribute.</p>

45045,What can I do to resolve a &quot;Row not found or changed&quot; Exception in LINQ to SQL on a SQL Server Compact Edition Database?,83999,"<p>Thats nasty, but simple:</p>

<p>Check if the data types for all fields in the O/R-Designer match the data types in your SQL table.
<strong>Double check for nullable!</strong> A column should be either nullable in both the O/R-Designer and SQL, or not nullable in both.</p>

<p>For example, a NVARCHAR column ""title"" is marked as NULLable in your database, and contains the value NULL. Even though the column is marked as NOT NULLable in your O/R-Mapping, LINQ will load it successfully and set the column-String to null.</p>

<ul>
<li>Now you change something and call
SubmitChanges().</li>
<li>LINQ will generate a SQL query
containing ""WHERE [title] IS NULL"", to make sure the title has not been changed by someone else.</li>
<li>LINQ looks up the properties of
[title] in the mapping.</li>
<li>LINQ will find [title] NOT NULLable.</li>
<li>Since [title] is NOT NULLable, by
logic it never could be NULL!</li>
<li>So, optimizing the query, LINQ
replaces it with ""where 0 = 1"", the
SQL equivalent of ""never"".</li>
</ul>

<p>The same symptom will appear when the data types of a field does not match the data type in SQL, or if fields are missing, since LINQ will not be able to make sure the SQL data has not changed since reading the data.</p>

<pre><code>gmail.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
</code></pre>

<p>Or set an explicit wait. An explicit waits is code you define to wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further in the code. In your case, it is the visibility of the password input field. (Thanks to ainlolcat's comment)</p>

<pre><code>WebDriver gmail= new ChromeDriver();
gmail.get(""https://www.gmail.co.in""); 
gmail.findElement(By.id(""Email"")).sendKeys(""abcd"");
gmail.findElement(By.id(""next"")).click();
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(gmail, 10);
WebElement element = wait.until(
ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(""Passwd"")));
gmail.findElement(By.id(""Passwd"")).sendKeys(""xyz"");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The reason selenium can't find the element is because the id of the password input field is initially Passwd-hidden. After you click on the ""Next"" button, Google first verifies the email address entered and then shows the password input field (by changing the id from Passwd-hidden to Passwd). So, when the password field is still hidden (i.e. Google is still verifying the email id), your webdriver starts searching for the password input field with id Passwd which is still hidden. And hence, an exception is thrown.</p>

<p>Cause:
The basic reason of this is the difference of key while encrypting and decrypting the viewstate data. Suppose an asp.net rendered a page with key1 and saved the page state in view state, meanwhile asp.net’s key is changed to key2, now when some server side event will occur on page the viewstate will get decrypted and this error will occur as the old view state is now not valid due to a different encryption key.</p>

<p>It may occur when you open a page for along time and after that do some events on that.</p>

<p>Solution
Fix the key in your web.config file, so that only one key is used to encrypt and decrypt the viewstate data.</p>

45571724,Exception: &#39;str&#39; object has no attribute &#39;text&#39;,45574458,"<p>One thing you want to get right from the very beginning is to use descriptive variable names. This will help you and anyone else that has to read your code understand what you are trying to do.</p>

<p>I changed a few variable names using my best guess at what they were. Obviously feel free to change them to whatever makes sense if I guessed wrong.</p>

<p><code>mylist</code> -> <code>labelList</code></p>

<p><code>allrows</code> -> <code>rowLabels</code></p>

<p><code>rows</code> -> <code>rowLabel</code> (singular since it's only one)</p>

<p>Removed some ""extra"" variables. I tend to not create a new variable if I'm not going to use it again. For example, <code>count</code> just holds <code>len(allrows)</code>. You can remove <code>count</code> and just use <code>len(allrows)</code> in the only place it shows up, in the <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>Removed some extra <code>""""</code>s you had in your locator, e.g. <code>...cardname + """" + str(i) + """"</code>. The <code>+ """" +</code> doesn't do anything here since you are just concatenating an empty string <code>""""</code> so I removed those.</p>

<p><code>rows.strip()</code> will remove the string if the substring exists. If the substring doesn't exist, it just returns the entire string. Since this is the case, you don't need an <code>if-else</code>.</p>

<p>The below code is how I would write this.</p>

<pre><code>def test(self, cardname):
    labelList = []
    allrows = self.driver.find_elements_by_xpath(""//*[contains(@id, 'scopes-pending-')]"")

    for i in range(len(allrows)):
        rowLabel = self.driver.find_element_by_id(""scopes-"" + cardname + str(i)).text
        labelList.append(rowLabel.strip('NEW'))

    return labelList

<p><strong>DO NOT DO THIS.</strong> If your app enters a state where even just launching it causes a crash, you will create an endless loop of crashing and relaunching that the user cannot get out of.</p>

<p>The error message is not weird; it is the system message, and it is translated in all supported languages on the device.</p>

<p>The only thing you should be doing is using some kind of <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=android%20crash%20reporting"" rel=""noreferrer"">crash reporting library</a> to report crashes back to you without the user having to do anything, so that you can fix your app and submit an update. You can set a custom <code>UncaughtExceptionHandler</code> in your Application's <code>onCreate()</code>, but I would limit this to logging data and perhaps preparing to send that to you for debugging purposes, and then <strong>forward the call back to the default <code>UncaughtExceptionHandler</code></strong>. This is exactly what a crash reporting library does.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know the best way to prevent system crashes is catching all possible exception in different methods. So I use try catch blocks every where in my code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the best way to to write good code and fix bugs before releasing. It is considered bad practice to catch all forms of exceptions indiscriminately. You should be using try-catch blocks only where either</p>

<ol>
<li>A method call can throw a checked exception, in which case the compiler forces you to surround with try-catch or rethrow the exception; or</li>
<li>You want to handle certain unchecked (runtime) exceptions. An example would be parsing user input with something like <code>Integer.parseInt()</code>, catching the <code>NumberFormatException</code> and showing message to the user that their input is invalid.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>However as you know sometimes you forget to test some scenarios</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then improve your coding and your testing practices. Do not use this as an excuse for taking rash actions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately the people who will use my app are not native English, so they will not understand crash message too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which crash message? If you mean the system's crash message, that should be in whatever language they set their device to. If you mean <strong>your</strong> crashmessage (e.g. in logcat), they shouldn't have to. They should send you the crash message, you should fix the app and distribute an update. Don't expect an end user to do any legwork in determining what causes your app to crash. Better to use some kind of crash reporting library.</p>

<p>However, as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/13087/joe"">Joe</a> correctly points out in a comment on an earlier revision of this reply, some messages are already (partially) loaded from the language resources at the time the exception is thrown.</p>

<p>This applies to the 'parameter cannot be null' part of the message generated when an ArgumentNullException(""foo"") exception is thrown, for example. In those cases, the message will still appear (partially) localized, even when using the above code.</p>

<p>Other than by using impractical hacks, such as running all your non-UI code on a thread with en-US locale to begin with, there doesn't seem to be much you can do about that: the .NET Framework exception code has no facilities for overriding the error message locale.</p>

<p>What this does is tell the framework to redirect assembly bindings for <code>mscorlib</code>'s resources and <code>System.Xml</code>'s resources, for versions between 1 and 999, in french (culture is set to &quot;<code>fr</code>&quot;) to an assembly that ... does not exists (an arbitrary version 999).</p>
<p>So when the CLR will look for french resources for these two assemblies (mscorlib and System.xml), it will not find them and fallback to English gracefully. Depending on your context and testings, you might want to add other assemblies to these redirects (assemblies that contains localized resources).</p>
<p>Of course I don't think this is supported by Microsoft, so use at your own risk. Well, in case you detect a problem, you can just remove this configuration and check it's unrelated.</p>

7915215,How do I convert a Win32 exception code to a string?,33044930,"<p>Structured exception codes are defined through NTSTATUS numbers. Although someone from MS suggests <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/259693"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (the article has been moved to <a href=""https://www.betaarchive.com/wiki/index.php?title=Microsoft_KB_Archive/259693"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) using <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679351(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FormatMessage()</a> to convert NTSTATUS numbers to strings, I would not do this. Flag <code>FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM</code> is used to convert result of <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679360(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GetLastError()</a> into a string, so it makes no sense here. Using flag <code>FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_HMODULE</code> along with <code>ntdll.dll</code> will lead to incorrect results for some codes. E.g., for <code>EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION</code> you will get <code>The instruction at 0x</code>, which is not very informative :) .</p>
<p>When you look at the strings that are stored in <code>ntdll.dll</code> it becomes obvious that many of them are supposed to be used with the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/56e442dc.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">printf()</a> function, not with the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679351(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FormatMessage()</a>. For example, the string for <code>EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION</code> is:</p>
<p><code>The instruction at 0x%08lx referenced memory at 0x%08lx. The memory could not be %s.</code></p>
<p><code>%0</code> is treated by <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679351(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FormatMessage()</a> as the escape sequence meaning message terminator, not an insert. Inserts are %1 to %99. That's why flag <code>FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS</code> does not make any difference.</p>
<p>You might want to load the string from <code>ntdll.dll</code> and pass it to <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/vfprintf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vprintf()</a> but you will need to prepare arguments exactly as the string specifies (e.g. for <code>EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION</code> it's <code>unsigned long</code>, <code>unsigned long</code>, <code>char*</code>). And this approach has major drawback: any change in the number, order or size of arguments in <code>ntdll.dll</code> may break your code.</p>
<p>So it's safer and easier to hard code the strings into your own code. I find it dangerous to use strings prepared by someone else without coordination with me :) and moreover for other function. This is just one more possibility for malfunction.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>In the .NET Framework, the internal <a href=""https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Data/fx/src/data/System/Data/SqlClient/TdsParser.cs,2410"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TdsParser</a> class is responsible for sending queries to SQL Server in binary format. The class contains the following lines of code (2410-2411):</p>
<pre><code>_defaultCodePage = Int32.Parse(stringCodePage, NumberStyles.Integer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
_defaultEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(_defaultCodePage);
</code></pre>
<p>This suggests that for all Latin1_General collations, TdsParser encodes strings using code page 1252, which is wrong for UTF-8 collations and produces garbage bytes.</p>

</code></pre>
"
27179011,C++ Exception - Throw a String,27179206,"<p><strong>Throwing a string is really a bad idea.</strong></p>
<p>In your code you are throwing a <code>const char*</code>. Throwing a built-in type (like an <code>int</code>, or <code>float</code>, or a <code>const char*</code> like in this case) is a bad idea because these built-in types don't carry proper contextual error information. In fact, when an exception is caught, it's important to understand the <em>reason</em> for the exception to take proper action. But a built-in type doesn't properly provide such information, making it difficult at the catch-site to understand the <em>reason</em> and the <em>cause</em> for the exception.</p>
<p>Moreover, throwing a built-in type is also confusing, as it's not idiomatic modern C++. The idiomatic C++ way of throwing an exception is to define a <strong>proper C++ class</strong> to represent the exception, typically deriving it from <code>std::exception</code>, or from some other class derived from <code>std::exception</code>, and then <code>throw</code> an instance of such exception class.
You could also simply throw some of the C++ exception classes already defined in the C++ Standard Library, like <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/runtime_error"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>std::runtime_error</code></a>.</p>
<p>For example, you could throw a <code>std::runtime_error</code>, passing an error message string to the constructor, like this:</p>
<pre><code>throw std::runtime_error(&quot;Your error message&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>and, at the catch site, you can catch the <code>runtime_error</code> exception by const reference (<code>const &amp;</code>), and invoke the <code>what()</code> method to get the error string.</p>
<pre><code>try {
    ...
} catch (const std::runtime_error&amp; ex) {
    // Invoke ex.what() to get the error message
}
</code></pre>
<p>But do <em>not</em> throw the &quot;naked&quot; string.</p>
<hr />
<p>In case you want to define a <strong>custom exception class</strong>, you can derive it for example from <code>std::runtime_error</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>class YourCustomException
    : public std::runtime_error 
{
  public:

    YourCustomException(const char* message)
        : std::runtime_error(message) {
    }

    YourCustomException(const std::string&amp; message)
        : std::runtime_error(message) {
    }
};
</code></pre>
<p>throw it like this:</p>
<pre><code>throw YourCustomException(&quot;Your error message&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>and catch it like this:</p>
<pre><code>try {
    ...
} catch (const YourCustomException&amp; ex) {

<p>Three conditions must be met to use a JavaFX file and a CSS file together:</p>

<ol>
<li>both JavaFX file and CSS file must both be in same directory</li>
<li><p>You must declare in your code you are using the CSS file such as </p>

<pre><code>  scene.getStylesheets().add(welcome.class.getResource(""background.css"").toExternalForm());
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>And the thing I think was being left out is <strong>package PackageName;</strong> </p>

<p><strong>package YourPackageName;</strong>.<br>
Will be at the top of your JavaFX file before the place where you define your imports.  This is something that could be easily forgotten if you are not used to working with multiple files in Java or if you start your code from scratch.  Not having the <strong>package YourPackageName;</strong> does not stop your base file from working, but it can stop your program from running when you try to use your own defined CSS files.</p></li>

32858606,OutOfMemory Exception while executing JAVA Mapping,32858987,"<p>There are plenty of things wrong with your code.
First of all I recommend switching to <code>OutputStreamWriter</code> instead of <code>OutputStream</code> as your parameter (you're not writing binary data, but character data).</p>

<p>Write out the headers first, then start processing the inputstream in chunks of let's say 8192 bytes (don't use <code>inputstream.available()</code> ever, you won't need it). If you don't know the ""standard"" way of processing streams, go through <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/"" rel=""nofollow"">Java IO Essentials</a>. Basically you read a chunk of data, convert it to <code>Base64</code> write it out and repeat (until inputstream is exhausted). NOTE! You have to make sure you encode chunks of size divisible by 3 (except for the last chunk), otherwise there will be padding applied and it will mess up the result. The last chunk can have the padding.</p>

<p>After that you can write the footers, and the whole process will take barely any memory.</p>
"
32858606,OutOfMemory Exception while executing JAVA Mapping,32859032,"<p>Taking a look at your code you store the data three times:</p>

<p>The first time is in byte array from the input stream. The second time is in the encoded String and finally you write it to the output stream.</p>

<p>What you can do to optimize this a bit is to split the reading from the input stream/encoding and the writing of the encoded string to the output stream. That way you can let go of the input byte array once encoded and the memory can be freed. An even better solution would be when the encoder directly writes to the Output stream or directly write to an <a href=""https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/apidocs/org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Base64OutputStream.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">encoding output stream</a>.</p>

<p>However you will still have to consider what the maximum file size should be that can be processed and adjust the heap setting accordingly: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37335/how-to-deal-with-java-lang-outofmemoryerror-java-heap-space-error-64mb-heap"">How to deal with &quot;java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space&quot; error (64MB heap size)</a></p>

As far as I remember, the default heap size is 256kb and since you encode your complete file at once as base64, you need to set a heap size of at least 1.5 times your filesize. </p>

<pre><code>@ControllerAdvice // Specialization of @Component for classes that declare @ExceptionHandler, @InitBinder, or @ModelAttribute methods to be shared across multiple @Controller classes.

    return response;

3702675,Catch and print full Python exception traceback without halting/exiting the program,16946886,"<p>Some other answer have already pointed out the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html"">traceback</a> module.</p>

<p>Please notice that with <code>print_exc</code>, in some corner cases, you will not obtain what you would expect. In Python 2.x:</p>

<pre><code>import traceback

try:
    raise TypeError(""Oups!"")
except Exception, err:
    try:
        raise TypeError(""Again !?!"")
    except:
        pass

    traceback.print_exc()

  File ""e.py"", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
    raise TypeError(""Again !?!"")
TypeError: Again !?!
</code></pre>

<p><strong>If you really need to access the original <em>traceback</em></strong> one solution is to cache the <em>exception infos</em> as returned from <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info""><code>exc_info</code></a> in a local variable and display it using <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/traceback.html#traceback.print_exception""><code>print_exception</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>import traceback
import sys

try:
    raise TypeError(""Oups!"")
except Exception, err:
    try:
        exc_info = sys.exc_info()

        # do you usefull stuff here
        # (potentially raising an exception)
        try:
            raise TypeError(""Again !?!"")
        except:
            pass
        # end of useful stuff


    finally:
        # Display the *original* exception
        traceback.print_exception(*exc_info)
        del exc_info
</code></pre>

<p>Producing:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""t.py"", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    raise TypeError(""Oups!"")
TypeError: Oups!
</code></pre>

<p>Few pitfalls with this though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>From the doc of <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info""><code>sys_info</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assigning the traceback return value to a local variable in a function that is handling an exception will cause a <strong>circular reference</strong>. This will prevent anything referenced by a local variable in the same function or by the traceback from being garbage collected. [...] <strong>If you do need the traceback, make sure to delete it after use</strong> (best done with a try ... finally statement)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>but, from the same doc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Beginning with Python 2.2, such cycles are automatically reclaimed</strong> when garbage collection is enabled and they become unreachable, but it remains more efficient to avoid creating cycles.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>On the other hand, by allowing you to access the traceback <em>associated with</em> an exception, Python 3 produce a less surprising result:</p>

<pre><code>import traceback

try:
    raise TypeError(""Oups!"")
except Exception as err:
    try:
        raise TypeError(""Again !?!"")
    except:
        pass

    traceback.print_tb(err.__traceback__)
</code></pre>

61434729,handling exception in ASP .NET 3.1 core controller when using razor pages,61444833,"<p>I finally figured out what happened. My controller was handling POST method. When any unhandled exceptions occurred, the code would attempt to run my exception handler. Because of the POST, it would post to my exception handler page, but that would fail because of AntiForgery request validation token missing, so it issue HTTP 400 - Bad Request, which I have seen before in my pages that use jQuery with AJAX if token was missing. So basically, to solve this issue, I'm going to add [IgnoreAntiforgeryToken] attribute to my razor error page handler.</p>

381760,SAP .NET Connector: System exception thrown while marshaling .NET type,382242,"<p><strong>Update 4:</strong> In second thought, I don't think that the librfc version is important. The exception seems to come from the managed code. The options that I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to use debugger on the single threaded version.</li>
<li>The magical way. Even without finding the bug ( That is on sap or your code). Just changing the way you do business can make it go away. Its ugly, but sometimes practical. Anyway the recommended way for your scenario seems to be to use connection pool, and not to create new proxy object for each request. So something like this (untested) code can be used:</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<pre><code>MySapProxy proxy = new MySapProxy(); // do this only once.

// and in you main loop:
using (proxy.Connection = Connection.GetConnection(connectionString))

<p>This sample is using implicitly the connection pool. The use of can be controlled from the config file. </p>

"
381760,SAP .NET Connector: System exception thrown while marshaling .NET type,617691,"<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>I still think it's something to do with the mapping. I believe that RFCTYPE_BCD type is decimal (Business Connector Decimal), so it will have difficulty pushing a date value into it (and could possibly work sometimes?). I would suggest regenerating the proxies, or log the data being marshalled when you get the error. Something like this (sorry - we use our own proxy layer, so I'm not that familiar with Business Connector):</p>

<p>Could you translate the following into VB (and whatever the format of the sapTable structure is):</p>

<pre><code>Using sapConnection As New MySapProxy(ConnectionString)
  sapConnection.Connection.Open()

<p>I know it's a pain, but just do a quick and dirty to get some data to spit out when the error occurs.</p>

<p>========</p>

<p>From just the description you've posted, the best I can come up with is perhaps you are trying to marshal a date value (20081219) into a time field?</p>

<p>Can you wrap that call in a try/catch and log the values of the table being sent to SAP and post those here? I'm hoping there's a clue in the data.</p>

4400517,How can I read a file even when getting an &quot;in use by another process&quot; exception?,4400781,"<p>I'll do the fish.  The FileShare mode is critical, you must allow for write sharing.  That cannot be denied since the process that is writing the file already obtained write access.  The StreamReader() constructor uses FileShare.Read and doesn't have an option to use a different value.  Using the StreamReader(Stream) constructor is instead is indeed the workaround.</p>

<p>Beware however that this sharing mode also has implications for your code.  You cannot predict when the other process flushes the file.  The last line you read may contain only part of a line of text.  When it flushes is file buffer again, later, you'll get the rest of the line.  Clearly this can mess up your logic.</p>

9017521,Object synchronization method was called from an unsynchronized block of code. Exception on Mutex.Release(),9017728,"<p>Keeping a bool around that indicates that the mutex is owned is a grave mistake.  You are not making the bool thread-safe.  You got into this pickle because you are using the wrong synchronization object.  A mutex has thread-affinity, the owner of a mutex is a thread.  The thread that acquired it must also be the one that calls ReleaseMutex().  Which is why your code bombs.</p>

<p>You in all likelihood need an <em>event</em> here, use AutoResetEvent.  Create it in the main thread, call Set() in the worker, WaitOne() in the main thread to wait for the worker to complete its job.  And dispose it afterwards.  Also note that using a thread to perform a job and having your main thread wait for its completion is not productive.  You might as well have the main thread do the job.</p>

<p>If you are actually doing this to protect access to an object that's not thread-safe (it isn't clear) then use the <em>lock</em> statement.</p>
"
4400517,How can I read a file even when getting an &quot;in use by another process&quot; exception?,12127571,"<p>It depends on the <code>FileShare</code> mode with which the file was opened by the other application that is appending to the file. When the other application was opening the file, it specified a <code>FileShare</code> mode for other applications to access the file. This <code>FileShare</code> mode could have been <strong>read, write, both, delete, all of these, or none</strong>.</p>

<p>You have to specify the very same <code>FileShare</code> mode that the other application specified. If the other application allowed only reading, use <code>FileShare.Read;</code> if it allowed both reading and writing, use <code>FileShare.ReadWrite</code>.</p>

<p><code>StreamReader</code> uses only <code>FileShare.Read</code> mode, so you can already assume that that's not the right one. So, try ReadWrite, like so:</p>

<pre><code>FileStream fs = new FileStream(FullPath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite);

<p>and then replace ErrorBoundary with MyErrorBoundary in all your code. Voilà.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to collect it send it to the logger and recover the previous state.</p>

@inject IJSRuntime jsRuntime

&lt;CascadingValue Value=&quot;this&quot;&gt;
@ChildContent

{

        ex.GetType(), ex.Message);
    jsRuntime.ToastrError(&quot;An Error has occured!&quot;); 
    //StateHasChanged();       
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p><code>Error</code> component can log errors using the Blazor built-in logger and display JavaScript error messages with <a href=""https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Toastr</a> through the <code>ProcessError</code> method. Obviously, other loggers such as Serilog, Elmah and even other custom loggers can be used to log in this method.</p>
<p><code>StateHasChanged</code> will be used when the error handling method wants to directly intervene in the rendering of the user interface of the component where an exception occurred. For example, when we want to make a change in the rendered elements of the page after an error (change the color of a button or the font color of a label or text box or...).</p>
<p>Now, we edit the <code>App.razor</code> component as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Error&gt;
    &lt;Router ...&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/Error&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, we enclose the Router component by our own custom component (Error.razor) so that the Error component is cascaded to any program component that considers Error as <code>[CascadingParameter]</code>.</p>
<p>Now, it is enough to process errors as follows in other components:</p>
<pre><code>@code {
    [CascadingParameter]
    public Error? Error { get; set; }

    private void CreatePost()
    {
        try
        {
           throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;a message!&quot;);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Error?.ProcessError(ex);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the Error component is defined as a <code>CascadingParameter</code> and in a try catch block, the <code>ProcessError</code> method of the Error component is called and the issued exception is sent to it. In my example, the Error component has only one error handling method. Obviously, this component can have several other custom error handling methods for different purposes.</p>

3491213,logging exception in c#,3491230,"<p>I find that the easiest way to log exceptions in C# is to call the <code>ToString()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>try
{

}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This usually gives you all the information you need such as the error message and the stack trace, plus any extra exception specific context information. (however note that the stack trace will only show you source files and line numbers if you have your application compiled with debug information)</p>

<p>It is worth noting however that seeing a full stack trace can be fairly offputting for the user and so wherever possible you should try to handle exceptions and print out a more friendly error message.</p>

<p>On another note - <strong>you should replace your method <code>WriteLogError</code> with a fully featured logging framework (like <a href=""https://serilog.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Serilog</a>)</strong> instead of trying to write your own.</p>

<p>Your logging method is not thread safe (your log file will probably end up with log messages being intermingled with each other) and also should definitely not call itself if you catch an exception - this will mean that any exceptions that occur whilst logging errors will probably cause a difficult to diagnose StackOverflow exception.</p>

<p>I could suggest how to fix those things, however you would be much better served just using a proper logging framework.</p>

75370795,"While producing the messages, some brokers going breaking down makes any exception in Kafka producer side?",75373185,"<p>I'm not sure if I understood your question, but in Kafka client API there are some retryable Exceptions (like Not Leader, or unreached/unknown host).</p>
<p>So your Producer wil retry until reaching the first limit of these two configs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>retries</strong></em> : <a href=""https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs_retries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs_retries</a></li>

</ul>
<p>So using the default values :
retries &gt; <strong>2 billions</strong> time &amp;
delivery.timeout.ms = <strong>2 minutes</strong></p>
<p>Your producer will do <strong>N</strong> retries for only <strong>2 minutes</strong> then crashes.</p>
"
75370795,"While producing the messages, some brokers going breaking down makes any exception in Kafka producer side?",75373199,"<p>It all depends on your requirements and your producer configuration. At the moment, yes you can have 2 out of 3 brokers alive and your producer will continue as normal.</p>
<p>This is because you have <code>acks=1</code> which means only the leader has to acknowledge the message before it is considered successful. The followers don't have to acknowledge the message.</p>
<p>You should also check whether you have changed <code>min.insync.replicas</code> at the broker or topic level configuration. The default is 1, meaning only 1 in-sync replica is needed for a broker to allow acks=all requests.</p>
<p>Side note: you have <code>replication=2</code>, I'd change this so partitions were replicated across all 3 brokers.</p>
"
75370795,"While producing the messages, some brokers going breaking down makes any exception in Kafka producer side?",76520326,"<p>Based on your description and configuration, it seems that your assumption is correct. As long as at least one broker is available, the producer-side app should be able to continue sending messages without errors.
Here are some additional points to consider:
Ensure that the Kafka cluster is properly configured for high availability. This includes setting up replication and ensuring that each broker has enough resources to handle the expected workload.</p>
<p>Consider implementing a retry mechanism in your producer-side app to handle cases where a broker becomes temporarily unavailable. For example, you could use an exponential backoff strategy to retry failed messages after increasing intervals.</p>
<p>Consider implementing a load balancing strategy in your producer-side app to distribute messages evenly across all available brokers. This can help prevent overloading any single broker and improve overall system performance.</p>
<p>Regularly monitor the health of your Kafka cluster to detect and address any issues before they become critical. This can include monitoring metrics such as message throughput, broker CPU and memory usage, and network latency.
Overall, it's important to ensure that your Kafka cluster is properly configured for high availability and that your producer-side app is resilient to temporary failures in the cluster. By implementing best practices for high availability and monitoring, you can help ensure that your system is able to handle unexpected issues and provide reliable message delivery.</p>

Instead of trying to suppress a log (error) message when you are excepting it, instead verify it is actually logged. This is somewhat the thing @knittl suggested in comments.</p>

14941625,Correct handling of exception: &quot;getParameters failed (empty parameters)&quot;,16123406,"<p>As +Eddy Talvala mentioned, this happens when the <strong>camera is in a bad state</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How does the camera get in a bad state?</strong></p>

<p>1) Probably the most common reason would be closing/releasing the camera while still using it afterward.  This can be especially problematic if you are using the <code>Camera</code> object on multiple threads without synchronizing access to the <code>Camera</code>.  Make sure you only ever have a single thread accessing the <code>Camera</code> at a time.</p>

<p>2) In my case it was a bit more tricky. I use a <code>SurfaceTexture</code> so that I can use the camera output as an OpenGL texture. In Android 4.0 (ICS), there is a new method <code>SurfaceTexture.release()</code>. This method is important to use when using <code>SurfaceTexture</code>s as it cleans up the memory quicker than it previously did.  </p>

<p>The problem is that I was calling <code>SurfaceTexture.release()</code> while the camera preview was still active.  This was crashing the <code>Camera</code> service, which was causing the issue explained in the question.</p>

<p>In my case I fixed it by delaying the call to <code>SurfaceTexture.release()</code> until after I had replaced it with a new <code>SurfaceTexture</code>. This way I was certain the <code>SurfaceTexture</code> could be cleaned up without any bad side-effects.</p>

14941625,Correct handling of exception: &quot;getParameters failed (empty parameters)&quot;,14944035,"<p>Is there a specific Android device that experiences this error? Or do you see it across many devices. </p>

<p>In general, you should not see this kind of an error.  It's possible your application has some sort of race condition which results in this, but it'd have to involve trying to call getParameters on an uninitialized or already-released camera.</p>

<p>It could also be an error in the device-specific camera code, or a rare race condition somewhere in the camera code stack. Without more detail (logcat or Android bugreport from such a crash), it's impossible to tell - the error itself just says that the device-specific camera code returned an empty set of parameters.</p>

<p>But once you get this error, there's not a lot you can do - the camera subsystem is in some odd state. If you want to try to deal with it, all I can suggest is to close and reopen the camera device.</p>

45787237,Exception handled surprisingly in PyQt/Pyside slots,45800282,"<p>As you've already noted in your question, the real issue here is the treatment of unhandled exceptions raised in python code executed from C++. So this is not only about signals: it also affects reimplemented virtual methods as well.</p>

<p>In PySide, PyQt4, and all PyQt5 versions up to 5.5, the default behaviour is to automatically catch the error on the C++ side and dump a traceback to stderr. Normally, a python script would also automatically terminate after this. But that is not what happens here. Instead, the PySide/PyQt script just carries on regardless, and many people quite rightly regard this as a bug (or at least a misfeature). In PyQt-5.5, this behaviour has now been changed so that <code>qFatal()</code> is also called on the C++ side, and the program will abort like a normal python script would. (I don't know what the current situation is with PySide2, though).</p>

<p>So - what should be done about all this? The best solution for all versions of PySide and PyQt is to install an <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?#sys.excepthook"" rel=""noreferrer"">exception hook</a> - because it will always take precedence over the default behaviour (whatever that may be). Any unhandled exception raised by a signal, virtual method or other python code will firstly invoke <code>sys.excepthook</code>, allowing you to fully customise the behaviour in whatever way you like.</p>

<p>In your example script, this could simply mean adding something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def excepthook(cls, exception, traceback):
    print('calling excepthook...')
    logger.error(""{}"".format(exception))

sys.excepthook = excepthook
</code></pre>

<p>and now the exception raised by <code>on_raise_with_signal</code> can be handled in the same way as all other unhandled exceptions.</p>

<p>Of course, this does imply that best practice for most PySide/PyQt applications is to use largely centralised exception handling. This often includes showing some kind of crash-dialog where the user can report unexpected errors.</p>
"
45787237,Exception handled surprisingly in PyQt/Pyside slots,45793513,"<p>According to the <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/exceptionsafety.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Qt5 docs</a> you need to handle exceptions within the slot being invoked.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throwing an exception from a slot invoked by Qt's signal-slot connection mechanism is considered undefined behaviour, unless it is handled within the slot</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>State state;
StateListener stateListener;

// OK; the exception is handled before it leaves the slot.
QObject::connect(&amp;state, SIGNAL(stateChanged()), &amp;stateListener, SLOT(throwHandledException()));
// Undefined behaviour; upon invocation of the slot, the exception will be propagated to the
// point of emission, unwinding the stack of the Qt code (which is not guaranteed to be exception safe).
QObject::connect(&amp;state, SIGNAL(stateChanged()), &amp;stateListener, SLOT(throwUnhandledException()));
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the slot was invoked directly, like a regular function call,
  exceptions may be used. This is because the connection mechanism is
  bypassed when invoking slots directly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the first case you call <code>slot_raise_exception()</code> directly, so this is fine. </p>

<p>In the second case you are invoking it via the <code>raise_exception</code> signal, so the exception will only propagate up to the point where <code>slot_raise_exception()</code> is called. You need to place the <code>try/except/else</code> inside <code>slot_raise_exception()</code> for the exception to be handled correctly.</p>
"
45787237,Exception handled surprisingly in PyQt/Pyside slots,45806561,"<p>Thanks for answering guys. I found <em>ekhumoros</em> answer particularly useful to understand where the exceptions are handled and because of the idea to utilize <code>sys.excepthook</code>.</p>

<p>I mocked up a quick solution via context manager to temporarily extend the current <code>sys.excepthook</code> to record any exception in the realm of <em>""C++ calling Python""</em> (as it seems to happen when slots are invoked by signals or virtual methods) and possibly re-raise upon exiting the context to achieve expected control flow in <em>try/except/else/finally</em> blocks.</p>

<p>The context manager allows <code>on_raise_with_signal</code> to maintain the same control flow as <code>on_raise_without_signal</code> with the surrounding <em>try/except/else/finally</em> block.</p>

34479465,Global exception handling in OWIN middleware,34493054,"<p>Ok, so this was easier than anticipated, thanks for @Khalid for the heads up, I have ended up creating an owin middleware named <code>OwinExceptionHandlerMiddleware</code> which is dedicated for handling any exception happening in any Owin Middleware (logging it and manipulating the response before returning it to the client).</p>

<p>You need to register this middleware as <strong>the first one</strong> in the <code>Startup</code> class as the below:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        var httpConfig = new HttpConfiguration();

        httpConfig.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();

        httpConfig.Services.Replace(typeof(IExceptionHandler), new ContentNegotiatedExceptionHandler());

        httpConfig.Services.Add(typeof(IExceptionLogger), new NLogExceptionLogger());

        OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions OAuthServerOptions = new OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions()
        {
            AllowInsecureHttp = true,
            TokenEndpointPath = new PathString(""/token""),
            AccessTokenExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromDays(1),
            Provider = new AuthorizationServerProvider()
        };

        //Should be the first handler to handle any exception happening in OWIN middlewares
        app.UseOwinExceptionHandler();

        // Token Generation
        app.UseOAuthAuthorizationServer(OAuthServerOptions);

        app.UseOAuthBearerAuthentication(new OAuthBearerAuthenticationOptions());

        app.UseWebApi(httpConfig);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the code used in the <code>OwinExceptionHandlerMiddleware</code> as the below:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>using AppFunc = Func&lt;IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;, Task&gt;;

public class OwinExceptionHandlerMiddleware

        }

        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; environment)
    {
        try

                return;
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                // If there's a Exception while generating the error page, re-throw the original exception.
            }
            throw;
        }
    }
    private void HandleException(Exception ex, IOwinContext context)
    {
        var request = context.Request;

        //Build a model to represet the error for the client
        var errorDataModel = NLogLogger.BuildErrorDataModel(ex);

        context.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError;
        context.Response.ReasonPhrase = ""Internal Server Error"";
        context.Response.ContentType = ""application/json"";
        context.Response.Write(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(errorDataModel));

"
34479465,Global exception handling in OWIN middleware,34481983,"<p>There are a few ways to do what you want:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create middleware that is registered <em>first</em>, then all exceptions will bubble up to that middleware. At this point just write out your JSON out via the Response object via the OWIN context.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also create a wrapping middleware which wraps the Oauth middleware. In this case it will on capture errors originating from this specific code path.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately writing your JSON message is about creating it, serializing it, and writing it to the Response via the OWIN context.</p>

<p>It seems like you are on the right path with #1. Hope this helps, and good luck :)</p>
"
34479465,Global exception handling in OWIN middleware,68381670,"<p>The accepted answer is unnecessarily complex and doesn't inherit from <strong>OwinMiddleware</strong> class</p>
<p>All you need to do is this:</p>

        public HttpLogger(OwinMiddleware next) : base(next) { }

<pre><code> appBuilder.Use(typeof(HttpLogger));

<p>Here's a quote from the link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Maximum Path Length Limitation</strong> In the Windows API (with some exceptions discussed in the following paragraphs), the maximum length
  for a path is MAX_PATH, which is defined as 260 characters. A local
  path is structured in the following order: drive letter, colon,
  backslash, name components separated by backslashes, and a terminating
  null character. For example, the maximum path on drive D is ""D:\some
  256-character path string&lt;NUL&gt;"" where ""&lt;NUL&gt;"" represents the invisible
  terminating null character for the current system codepage. (The
  characters &lt; &gt; are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of
  a valid path string.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a few workarounds (taken from the comments):</p>

<p>There are ways to solve the various problems. The basic idea of the solutions listed below is always the same: Reduce the path-length in order to have <code>path-length + name-length &lt; MAX_PATH</code>. You may:</p>

<ul>
<li>Share a subfolder</li>
<li>Use the commandline to assign a drive letter by means of SUBST</li>
<li>Use AddConnection under VB to assign a drive letter to a path</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update per comments</h2>
<p>To ensure that such errors still return a valid response, you can capture those exceptions of type <code>WebException</code> and fetch the related <code>Response</code>.</p>
<p>Since the response on the exception is of type <code>System.Net.HttpWebResponse</code>, whilst the response from a successful <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code> call is of type <code>Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.HtmlWebResponseObject</code>, to return a compatible type from both scenarios we need to take the successful response's <code>BaseResponse</code>, which is also of type <code>System.Net.HttpWebResponse</code>.</p>

2007106,Using Exception Handling versus NSError in Cocoa Apps,2010026,"<p>Daniel's answer is correct, but this question deserves a rather more blunt answer.</p>
<p>Throw an exception only when a non-recoverable error is encountered.</p>
<p>Use NSError when communicating error conditions that may be recovered from.</p>
<p><em><strong>Any exception that is thrown through a frame in Apple's frameworks may result in undefined behavior.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is an <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Exceptions/Exceptions.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Exceptions programming topic document</a> available in the dev center.</p>
"
2007106,Using Exception Handling versus NSError in Cocoa Apps,2007269,"<blockquote>
  <p>Essentially, my impression is that Apple thinks it best to avoid the use of exception handling language constructs except as a mechanism for halting program execution in unexpected error situations (maybe someone could give an example of such a situation?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not quite my impression. I thought that Apple suggests using exceptions for truly exceptional conditions, and NSError for expected failures. Since you come from Java, I think NSError -> java.lang.Exception, and Obj-C Exceptions -> java.lang.RuntimeException. Use an Obj-C exception when the programmer did something wrong (used an API incorrectly, for example), and use NSError when an expected failure occurred (the remote server could not be found, for example).</p>

<p>Of course, that's just my interpretation of Apple's position. I, on the other hand, like exceptions!</p>
"
2007106,Using Exception Handling versus NSError in Cocoa Apps,2007202,"<p>Exceptions in Objective-C have historically been 'heavy', with a performance cost to entering a try block, a cost to throwing, a cost to using finally, etc.  As a result Cocoa developers have typically avoided exceptions outside of 'oh no, the sky is falling' sorts of situations -- if a file is missing, use an NSError, but if there's no filesystem and a negative amount of free memory, that's an exception.</p>

<p>That's the historical view.  But if you're building a 64-bit app on 10.5 or newer, the exception architecture has been rewritten to be 'zero cost', which may mean that the historical view is no longer relevant.  As with just about anything, it comes down to various factors -- if working one way is more natural to you and will let you finish more quickly, and if you don't experience any performance-related problems with it, and if being slightly inconsistent with 'traditional' Objective-C code doesn't bother you... then there's no reason not to use exceptions.</p>

38434769,How to test that an expected exception is being thrown using google-truth?,38866403,"<p>[updated]</p>

<p>The Truth authors recommend using JUnit 4.13/5's <code>assertThrows()</code> mechanism, since this doesn't really need support in Truth.  This would look more like:</p>

<pre><code>SpecificException e = 
    assertThrows(SpecificException.class, () -&gt; doSomethingThatThrows());
assertThat(e).hasMessageThat().contains(""blah blah blah"");
assertThat(e).hasCauseThat().isInstanceOf(IllegalStateException.class);
assertThat(e).hasCauseThat().hasMessageThat().contains(""blah"");
</code></pre>

<p>This is recommended over try/fail/catch as it is terser, avoids the ""missing fail"" problem, and returns an object that can be asserted-on using the <code>ThrowableSubject</code> in Truth. </p>

<p>If you do not have <code>assertThrows()</code>, then please use the try/fail/catch pattern, as this is clear and explicit.</p>

<pre><code>try {
  doSomethingThatThrows(); 
  fail(""method should throw"");
} catch (SpecificException e) {
  // ensure that e was thrown from the right code-path
  // especially important if it's something as frequent
  // as an IllegalArgumentException, etc.
  assertThat(e).hasMessage(""blah blah blah"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>@Rule ExpectedException</code> and <code>@Test(exception=...)</code> exist in JUnit, these aren't recommended by the Truth team, insofar as they have some subtle (and less subtle) ways you can write tests that pass but which should fail.</p>

<p>While this is also true of try/fail/catch, internally Google mitigates this with the use of <a href=""http://github.com/google/error-prone"" rel=""noreferrer"">error-prone</a>, which provides a static compile-time check to ensure that this pattern doesn't omit the fail(), etc.  It is highly recommended that you use error-prone or another static analysis check to catch these.  Sadly, the rule-based and annotation-based methods aren't as easily amenable to static analysis as this try/catch block.</p>

58662285,How to test an exception case with zio-test,58666704,"<p>I think you've definitely got it. The only thing I would add for others with similar questions is your example also involves an environment type, which is a great topic for discussion but somewhat independent of how to test that an effect fails as expected using ZIO Test.</p>

<p>I've included below a minimal example of how to test that an effect fails as expected. As mentioned above, you would call <code>run</code> on the effect to get an exit value and then use <code>Assertion.fails</code> to assert that the effect fails with a checked exception, <code>Assertion.dies</code> to assert that the effect fails with an unchecked exception, or <code>Assertion.interrupted</code> to test that an effect was interrupted.</p>

<p>Also note that you do not have to use include <code>equalTo(""fail"")</code>. If all you care about is that the effect failed you can just use <code>fails(anything)</code>. If you are testing that an effect dies with a specified exception you can do something like <code>dies(isSubtype[IllegalArgumentException])</code>.</p>

67555913,Exception handling in streams with Either,67619699,"<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/67556075/542270"">Somjit's</a> answer shows correct approach however it uses an outer variable (<code>errors</code>) to accumulate the errors. This is, in general, discouraged since we should avoid the global/external state.</p>
<p>You can use vavr's <a href=""https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.vavr/vavr/latest/io/vavr/collection/Traversable.html#partition(java.util.function.Predicate)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>partition</code></a> method to split the stream into two: one with errors and one with validated ints. They are both put into a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>public void composeExceptions() {
   final Tuple2&lt;Stream&lt;Either&lt;IllegalArgumentException, Integer&gt;&gt;, Stream&lt;Either&lt;IllegalArgumentException, Integer&gt;&gt;&gt; both = Stream.range(1, 11)
            .map(this::validate)
            .partition(Either::isLeft);

   both._1.map(Either::getLeft).forEach(e -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;Got error: &quot; + e.getMessage()));
   both._2.map(Either::get).forEach(i -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;Validated correctly: &quot; + i));
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Actually there also other options like:</p>
<pre><code>Stream
   .range(1, 11)
   .map(this::validate)
   .toJavaStream()
   .collect(Collectors.teeing(
      Collectors.filtering(Either::isLeft, toList()),
      Collectors.filtering(Either::isRight, toList()),
      (errors, ints) -&gt; new Tuple2&lt;&gt;(errors.stream().map(Either::getLeft), ints.stream().map(Either::get))));
</code></pre>
<p>which uses <code>teeing</code> which is quite interesting collector from java API. Unfortunately it mixes vavr and java API which is not great, not terrible.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<pre><code>Stream
   .range(1, 11)
   .map(this::validate)
   .collect(
      () -&gt; new Tuple2&lt;&gt;(List.&lt;RuntimeException&gt;empty().asJavaMutable(), List.&lt;Integer&gt;empty().asJavaMutable()),
      (tuple, either) -&gt; {
         either.peekLeft(tuple._1::add);
         either.peek(tuple._2::add);
      },
      (t1, t2) -&gt; {
         t1._1.addAll(t2._1);
         t1._2.addAll(t2._2);
      }
    )
       .map((exceptions, integers) -&gt; new Tuple2&lt;&gt;(List.ofAll(exceptions), List.ofAll(integers)));

<p>which uses vavr API only but underneath uses java <code>List</code> since a mutable structure is required here.</p>
"
67555913,Exception handling in streams with Either,67556075,"<p>A simple way of handling the exceptions on the &quot;side track&quot; is by using the <code>peekleft</code> method Vavr provides, which consumes the <code>Either.Left()</code> side. We can plug our exception processing logic in there, and leave our <code>Either.right()</code> stuff nicely on the main track without any ugliness.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this can be improved, and would love ideas on improving this.</p>

1467568,Debug.Assert vs Exception Throwing,1468385,"<p>Though I agree that your reasoning is <em>plausible</em> -- that is, if an assertion is violated unexpectedly, it makes sense to halt execution by throwing -- I personally would not use exceptions in the place of assertions. Here's why:</p>

<p>As others have said, assertions should <em>document</em> situations that are <em>impossible</em>, in such a manner that if the allegedly impossible situation comes to pass, the developer is informed. Exceptions, by contrast, provide a control flow mechanism for exceptional, unlikely, or erroneous situations, but not impossible situations. For me, the key difference is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It should ALWAYS be possible to produce a test case which exercises a given throw statement. If it is not possible to produce such a test case then you have a code path in your program which never executes, and it should be removed as dead code.</p></li>
<li><p>It should NEVER be possible to produce a test case which causes an assertion to fire. If an assertion fires, either the code is wrong or the assertion is wrong; either way, something needs to change in the code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's why I would not replace an assertion with an exception. If the assertion cannot actually fire, then <strong>replacing it with an exception means you have an untestable code path in your program</strong>. I dislike untestable code paths. </p>
"
1467568,Debug.Assert vs Exception Throwing,1467580,"<p>Assertions are used to check the programmer's understanding of the world.  An assertion should fail only if the programmer has done something wrong.  For example, never use an assertion to check user input.</p>

<p>Asserts test for conditions that ""cannot happen"".  Exceptions are for conditions that ""should not happen but do"".</p>

<p>Assertions are useful because at build time (or even run time) you can change their behavior.  For example, often in release builds, the asserts aren't even checked, because they introduce unneeded overhead.  This is also something to be wary of: your tests may not even be executed.</p>

<p>If you use exceptions instead of asserts, you lose some value:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The code is more verbose, since testing and throwing an exception is at least two lines, while an assert is only one.</p></li>
<li><p>Your test and throw code will always run, while asserts can be compiled away.</p></li>
<li><p>You lose some communication with other developers, because asserts have a different meaning than product code that checks and throws.  If you are really testing a programming assertion, use an assert.</p></li>

1467568,Debug.Assert vs Exception Throwing,1467590,"<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
<em>In response to the edit/note you made in your post:
It sounds like using exceptions are the right thing to use over using assertions for the type of things you are trying to accomplish.
I think the mental stumbling block you are hitting is that you are considering exceptions and assertions to fulfill the same purpose, and so you are trying to figure out which one would be 'right' to use. While there may be some overlap in how assertions and exceptions can be used, don't confuse that for them being different solutions to the same problem- they aren't. Assertions and Exceptions each have their own purpose, strengths, and weaknesses.</em></p>

<p>I was going to type up an answer in my own words but this does the concept better justice than I would have:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.csharp-station.com/Articles/Assertions.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">C# Station: Assertions</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of assert statements can be an
  effective way to catch program logic
  errors at runtime, and yet they are
  easily filtered out of production
  code. Once development is complete,
  the runtime cost of these redundant
  tests for coding errors can be
  eliminated simply by defining the
  preprocessor symbol NDEBUG [which
  disables all assertions] during
  compilation. Be sure, however, to
  remember that code placed in the
  assert itself will be omitted in the
  production version. </p>
  
  <p>An assertion is best used to test a
  condition only when all of the
  following hold:</p>

<pre><code>* the condition should never be false if the code is correct,
* the condition is not so trivial so as to obviously be always true, and
* the condition is in some sense internal to a body of software.
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>Assertions should almost never be used to detect situations that arise
  during software's normal operation.</strong>
  For example, usually assertions should
  not be used to check for errors in a
  user's input. It may, however, make
  sense to use assertions to verify that
  a caller has already checked a user's
  input.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, use exceptions for things that need to be caught/dealt with in a production application, use assertions to perform logical checks that will be useful for development but turned off in production. </p>

40100960,session not created exception for chrome in Protractor,40121176,"<p>I don't have enough rep yet to leave a comment under Sudharsan's answer but the location of the config file he is telling you to modify is actually at </p>

<pre><code>node_modules/protractor/node_modules/webdriver-manager/config.json
</code></pre>

<p>It's not the protractor tsconfig but the webdriver-manager <code>config.json</code> that you want to modify. </p>

<p>That being said, I've run into this problem before and taken a different approach to solving it. The solution that Sudharsan provided would work if you only needed to install it once. We have our builds running in TFS which cleans out the build agents working directory and pulls in a fresh repo on each build. Changing the webdriver config would not work in this situation because we <code>npm install</code> all the things before each build. In this case it would always revert back to the older version of chromedriver. </p>

<p>What I did instead was added chromedriver to my devDependencies in the <code>package.json</code> and then I delete the version of chromedriver that webdriver-manager installs and move the updated version of chromedriver into the correct location with a gulp task. So in the package.json I have this listed under devDependencies:</p>

<pre><code>""chromedriver"": ""~2.24.1""
</code></pre>

<p>and then I have a gulp task that deletes and moves the files like this:</p>

<pre><code>var gulp = require('gulp');
var del = require('del');

var chromeDriverFilesToMove = [
    './node_modules/chromedriver/lib/chromedriver/**'
];

var chromeDriverFilesToDelete = [
    './node_modules/protractor/node_modules/webdriver-manager/selenium/chromedriver*.exe',
    './node_modules/protractor/node_modules/webdriver-manager/selenium/chromedriver*.zip'
];

gulp.task('delete-chromedriver', function() {
    return del(chromeDriverFilesToDelete);
});

gulp.task('move-chromedriver', function() {
    gulp.src(chromeDriverFilesToMove)
        .pipe(gulp.dest('node_modules/protractor/node_modules/webdriver-manager/selenium/'));
});

gulp.task('chromedriver-update', ['delete-chromedriver', 'move-chromedriver']);
</code></pre>

<p>And because protractor will still be looking for the older version of chromedriver that was installed when you ran <code>webdriver-manager update</code> you have to tell it where to look for the chromedriver.exe so add this to your protractor conf.js and it should start working. </p>

<pre><code>chromeDriver: ""../node_modules/protractor/node_modules/webdriver-manager/selenium/chromedriver.exe"",
</code></pre>

<p>It's kind of silly that we have to go through all this trouble to get it to work but chromedriver 2.22 doesn't seem to work with Chrome 53+. At least not in my experience. </p>

<p>TL;DR </p>

<p>If you only have to install it once use Sudharsan's solution (given you modify the correct config), it's easier. If you are in my situation and will have to install protractor continuously try my solution. It has worked well for me and I haven't run into this error since.</p>

4639432,Checked vs Unchecked exception,4639560,"<p>Unchecked exceptions are those that extend <code>RuntimeException</code> class. Compiler will never force you to catch such exception or force you to declare it in the method using <code>throws</code> keyword. All other exception types (that do not extend <code>RuntimeException</code>) are checked and therefore must be declared to be thrown and/or catched.</p>

<p>Checked exceptions are used when you want the caller of your method (i.e the user of your API) to explicitly handle the exceptional case in your API. Checked exceptions are declared when you believe the call will be able to do something meaningful with that exceptional case, like retrying the call, rolling changes back or converting it into some user-readable error message.</p>

<p>If you believe that there is nothing useful the call can do about the exception (especially when it represents a bug, or a wrong usage of your API), then the exception should be unchecked. Also, an API with too many checked exceptions can be annoying to program with (e.g. try using java reflection API=)</p>
"
4639432,Checked vs Unchecked exception,44120179,"<ul>
<li>Checked Exceptions are useful for handling events that occur in the normal operation of a program. An example would be an <code>IOException</code> that is thrown when a file cannot be opened. These exceptions occur even if there is nothing wrong with the program. It is necessary, therefore, to tell the program how to handle the exception.</li>
<li>Unchecked exceptions are useful for identifying defects in the code. For instance, a <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown when a value is read on a <code>null</code> object. Thus an Unchecked Exception represents a problem that requires a manual fix by the programmer. It is reasonable for the program to crash in order to avoid erroneous behavior, so a try-catch block is not required (but might be desirable in order to provide mitigation, such as displaying an error to the user). </li>
</ul>
"
4639432,Checked vs Unchecked exception,4639446,"<p>What is your question exactly?
Compilers shouldn't (and won't) enforce you to try/catch unchecked exceptions, that would go against exactly what they are.</p>

<p>The general idea is that checked exceptions are something you may be able to foresee but may be based on input that is out of your control and that you have to deal with.
Unchecked exceptions will usually represent bugs in your program.</p>

<p>There's a number of people that think checked exceptions are a mistake in the Java platform and they only use them very sparingly or not at all. You can read more about this debate by searching google.</p>

</code></pre>
<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p><code>lambda: 0</code> is an instance of the <code>builtins.function</code> class.<br />
<code>type(lambda: 0)</code> is the <code>builtins.function</code> class.<br />
<code>(lambda: 0).__code__</code> is a <code>code</code> object.<br />
A <code>code</code> object is an object which holds the compiled bytecode among other things.
It is defined here in CPython <a href=""https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/code.h"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/code.h</a>.
Its methods are implemented here <a href=""https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/codeobject.c"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/codeobject.c</a>.
We can run the help on the code object:</p>
<pre><code>Help on code object:

class code(object)
 |  code(argcount, kwonlyargcount, nlocals, stacksize, flags, codestring,
 |        constants, names, varnames, filename, name, firstlineno,
 |        lnotab[, freevars[, cellvars]])
 |  
 |  Create a code object.  Not for the faint of heart.
</code></pre>
<p><code>type((lambda: 0).__code__)</code> is the code class.<br />
So when we say</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>type((lambda: 0).__code__)(
    1,0,1,1,67,b'|\0\202\1\0',(),(),('x',),'','',1,b'')
</code></pre>
<p>we are calling the constructor of the code object with the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>argcount=1</li>
<li>kwonlyargcount=0</li>
<li>nlocals=1</li>
<li>stacksize=1</li>
<li>flags=67</li>
<li>codestring=b'|\0\202\1\0'</li>
<li>constants=()</li>
<li>names=()</li>
<li>varnames=('x',)</li>
<li>filename=''</li>
<li>name=''</li>
<li>firstlineno=1</li>
<li>lnotab=b''</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read about what the arguments mean in the definition of the <code>PyCodeObject</code>
<a href=""https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/code.h"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/code.h</a>.
The value of 67 for the <code>flags</code> argument is for example <code>CO_OPTIMIZED | CO_NEWLOCALS | CO_NOFREE</code>.</p>
<p>The most importand argument is the <code>codestring</code> which contains instruction opcodes.
Let's see what they mean.</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(b'|\0\202\1\0')
          0 LOAD_FAST                0 (0)
          2 RAISE_VARARGS            1
          4 &lt;0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The documentation of opcodes can by found here
<a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions</a>.
The first byte is the opcode for <code>LOAD_FAST</code>, the second byte is its argument i.e. 0.</p>
<pre><code>LOAD_FAST(var_num)
    Pushes a reference to the local co_varnames[var_num] onto the stack.
</code></pre>
<p>So we push the reference to <code>x</code> onto the stack. The <code>varnames</code> is a list of strings containing only 'x'.
We will push the only argument of the function we are defining to the stack.</p>
<p>The next byte is the opcode for <code>RAISE_VARARGS</code> and the next byte is its argument i.e. 1.</p>
<pre><code>RAISE_VARARGS(argc)
    Raises an exception using one of the 3 forms of the raise statement, depending on the value of argc:
        0: raise (re-raise previous exception)
        1: raise TOS (raise exception instance or type at TOS)
        2: raise TOS1 from TOS (raise exception instance or type at TOS1 with __cause__ set to TOS)
</code></pre>
<p>The TOS is the top-of-stack.
Since we pushed the first argument (<code>x</code>) of our function to the stack and <code>argc</code> is 1 we will raise the
<code>x</code> if it is an exception instance or make an instance of <code>x</code> and raise it otherwise.</p>
<p>The last byte i.e. 0 is not used. It is not a valid opcode. It might as well not be there.</p>
<p>Going back to code snippet we are anylyzing:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>type(lambda: 0)(type((lambda: 0).__code__)(
    1,0,1,1,67,b'|\0\202\1\0',(),(),('x',),'','',1,b''),{}
)(Exception())
</code></pre>
<p>We called the constructor of the code object:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>type((lambda: 0).__code__)(
    1,0,1,1,67,b'|\0\202\1\0',(),(),('x',),'','',1,b'')
</code></pre>
<p>We pass the code object and an empty dictionary to the constructor of a function object:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>type(lambda: 0)(type((lambda: 0).__code__)(
    1,0,1,1,67,b'|\0\202\1\0',(),(),('x',),'','',1,b''),{}
)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's call help on a function object to see what the arguments mean.</p>
<pre><code>Help on class function in module builtins:

class function(object)
 |  function(code, globals, name=None, argdefs=None, closure=None)
 |  
 |  Create a function object.
 |  
 |  code
 |    a code object
 |  globals
 |    the globals dictionary
 |  name
 |    a string that overrides the name from the code object
 |  argdefs
 |    a tuple that specifies the default argument values
 |  closure
 |    a tuple that supplies the bindings for free variables
</code></pre>
<p>We then call the constructed function passing an Exception instance as an argument.
Consequently we called a lambda function which raises an exception.
Let's run the snippet and see that it indeed works as intended.</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(lambda: 0)(type((lambda: 0).__code__)(
...     1,0,1,1,67,b'|\0\202\1\0',(),(),('x',),'','',1,b''),{}
... )(Exception())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
  File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in 
Exception
</code></pre>
<h1>Improvements</h1>
<p>We saw that the last byte of the bytecode is useless. Let's not clutter this
complicated expression needlesly. Let's remove that byte.
Also if we want to golf a little we could omit the instantiation of Exception
and instead pass the Exception class as an argument. Those changes would result

I've got past this problem and can't say for sure what exactly the cause was, but I'll share some of my observations.</p>
<p>In my situation, the error occurred when I opened an output stream to write some multipart html content to an http request. This is code that has been working correctly for several years, and suddenly this error started happening.  This is android code that I'm running on an emulator. The URL request is using my machines host name which has an Apache tomcat server which I run in debug mode using Eclipse.  I can easily set up some breakpoints on the Apache tomcat server to stop on receipt of the http request. But of course, this error is happening before the request gets to the tomcat server.</p>
<p>This particular error means that there is no IP address associated with my machines host name.  In theory, this error means that it recognizes the host name, but that hostname doesn't have an IP address associated with it.  This error message means that you have something wrong with your DNS resolution.  In my case, I needed to figure out how the DNS address gets resolved to an IP address for my machines hostname.  My network is configured to use a DSN server that is made available from my samba-ad-dc which is running on an UBUNTU server in my network.  When I examine the status of that server, I discovered that DNS server which is part of my samba-ad-dc configuration was masked, meaning that it can't be started.  I'm not certain how that DNS server became masked, but that certainly was part of my problem.  I unmasked that server, so my DNS server would start up and then restarted samba-ad-dc.  I would have thought that would have fixed the problem immediately, but it didn't. This is where I'm not certain what I did the caused things to work again. I rebooted my machine that was running the android studio emulator, but that too didn't fix the problem.  After a certain passage of time, things suddenly started to work again.  The one thing that comes to mind, is that it may have taken some time for the IP address of my hostname to be discovered. I'm not sure how the mechanism works for my hostname to IP address gets discovered and resolved. The internal samba-ad-dc is configured to forward DNS requests on to the DNS server on my router. I believe that my router caches hostnames with IP addresses and is configured to use public DNS servers for all other DNS requests. I tried eliminating the samba internal DNS altogether, but I never got that to work, so it leaves me with the impression that I need that samba internal DNS server to resolve local area hostnames. As you can perhaps see, this is where my knowledge about how the resolution actually works becomes a bit sketchy.</p>
<p>My advice for those running into this problem is to try and figure out how you host name gets resolve to an IP address in your network configuration. If you're dealing with local area hostnames how this works gets a little harder to figure out.</p>
<p>One more thing I should point out; from my windows environment I could talk to my tomcat server using my machines hostname when all this was happening.  This issue only occurred from within code that was running on my Android emulator.  I don't find that particularly odd, since I have my machine's hostname added to my windows &quot;hosts&quot; file.</p>

6086334,Is it good practice to make the constructor throw an exception?,6086399,"<p>Throwing exceptions in a constructor is not bad practice.  In fact, it is the <em>only</em> reasonable way for a constructor to indicate that there is a problem; e.g. that the parameters are invalid.</p>
<p>I also think that throwing <em>checked</em> exceptions can be OK<sup>1</sup>, assuming that the checked exception is 1) declared, 2) specific to the problem you are reporting, and 3) it is reasonable to expect the caller to deal with a checked exception for this<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>However explicitly declaring or throwing <code>java.lang.Exception</code> is almost always bad practice.</p>
<p>You should pick an exception class that matches the exceptional condition that has occurred.  If you throw <code>Exception</code> it is difficult for the caller to separate this exception from any number of other possible declared and undeclared exceptions.  This makes error recovery difficult, and if the caller chooses to propagate the Exception, the problem just spreads.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>1 - Some people may disagree, but IMO there is no substantive difference between this case and the case of throwing exceptions in methods.  The standard checked vs unchecked advice applies equally to both cases.<br>
2 - For example, the existing <code>FileInputStream</code> constructors will throw <code>FileNotFoundException</code> if you try to open a file that does not exist.  Assuming that it is reasonable for <code>FileNotFoundException</code> to be a checked exception<sup>3</sup>, then the constructor is the <em>most appropriate place</em> for that exception to be thrown.  If we threw the <code>FileNotFoundException</code> the first time that (say) a <code>read</code> or <code>write</code> call was made, that is liable to make application logic more complicated.<br>
3 - Given that this is one of the motivating examples for checked exceptions, if you don't accept this you are basically saying that all exceptions should be unchecked.  That is not practical ... if you are going to use Java.</sup></p>
<hr />
<p>Someone suggested using <code>assert</code> for checking arguments.  The problem with this is that checking of <code>assert</code> assertions can be turned on and off via a JVM command-line setting. Using assertions to check internal invariants is OK, but using them to implement argument checking that is specified in your javadoc is not a good idea ... because it means your method will only strictly implement the specification when assertion checking is enabled.</p>
<p>The second problem with <code>assert</code> is that if an assertion fails, then <code>AssertionError</code> will be thrown.  Received wisdom is that it is a <em>bad idea</em> to attempt to catch <code>Error</code> and any of its subtypes.  But  irrespective of that, you are still throwing an exception, albeit in an indirect way.</p>
"
6086334,Is it good practice to make the constructor throw an exception?,28327058,"<p>I've always considered throwing checked exceptions in the constructor to be bad practice, or at least something that should be avoided.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that you cannot do this :</p>

<pre><code>private SomeObject foo = new SomeObject();
</code></pre>

<p>Instead you must do this :</p>

<pre><code>private SomeObject foo;
public MyObject() {
    try {
        foo = new SomeObject()
    } Catch(PointlessCheckedException e) {
       throw new RuntimeException(""ahhg"",e);
    }

</code></pre>

<p>At the point when I'm constructing <i>SomeObject</i> I know what it's parameters are
so why should I be expected to wrap it in a try catch?
Ahh you say but if I'm constructing an object from dynamic parameters I don't know if they're valid or not.
Well, you could... validate the parameters before passing them to the constructor. That would be good practice.
And if all you're concerned about is whether the parameters are valid then you can use IllegalArgumentException.</p>

<p>So instead of throwing checked exceptions just do</p>

    if (param.length()==0) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""no really, please stop"");

6086334,Is it good practice to make the constructor throw an exception?,27830805,"<p>As mentioned in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1373419/644035"">another answer here</a>, in Guideline 7-3 of the Java <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/seccodeguide-139067.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Secure Coding Guidelines</a>, throwing an exception in the constructor of a non-final class opens a potential attack vector:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Guideline 7-3 / OBJECT-3: Defend against partially initialized
  instances of non-final classes When a constructor in a non-final class
  throws an exception, attackers can attempt to gain access to partially
  initialized instances of that class. Ensure that a non-final class
  remains totally unusable until its constructor completes successfully.</p>
  
  <p>From JDK 6 on, construction of a subclassable class can be prevented
  by throwing an exception before the Object constructor completes. To
  do this, perform the checks in an expression that is evaluated in a
  call to this() or super().</p>

<pre><code>    // non-final java.lang.ClassLoader
    public abstract class ClassLoader {
        protected ClassLoader() {
            this(securityManagerCheck());
        }
        private ClassLoader(Void ignored) {
            // ... continue initialization ...
        }
        private static Void securityManagerCheck() {
            SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
            if (security != null) {
                security.checkCreateClassLoader();
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
  
  <p>For compatibility with older releases, a potential solution involves
  the use of an initialized flag. Set the flag as the last operation in
  a constructor before returning successfully. All methods providing a
  gateway to sensitive operations must first consult the flag before
  proceeding:</p>

<pre><code>    public abstract class ClassLoader {

        private volatile boolean initialized;

        protected ClassLoader() {
            // permission needed to create ClassLoader
            securityManagerCheck();
            init();

            // Last action of constructor.
            this.initialized = true;
        }
        protected final Class defineClass(...) {
            checkInitialized();

            // regular logic follows
            ...
        }

        private void checkInitialized() {
            if (!initialized) {
                throw new SecurityException(
                    ""NonFinal not initialized""
                );
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Furthermore, any security-sensitive uses of such classes should check
  the state of the initialization flag. In the case of ClassLoader
  construction, it should check that its parent class loader is
  initialized.</p>
  
  <p>Partially initialized instances of a non-final class can be accessed
  via a finalizer attack. The attacker overrides the protected finalize
  method in a subclass and attempts to create a new instance of that
  subclass. This attempt fails (in the above example, the
  SecurityManager check in ClassLoader's constructor throws a security
  exception), but the attacker simply ignores any exception and waits
  for the virtual machine to perform finalization on the partially
  initialized object. When that occurs the malicious finalize method
  implementation is invoked, giving the attacker access to this, a
  reference to the object being finalized. Although the object is only
  partially initialized, the attacker can still invoke methods on it,
  thereby circumventing the SecurityManager check. While the initialized
  flag does not prevent access to the partially initialized object, it
  does prevent methods on that object from doing anything useful for the
  attacker.</p>
  
  <p>Use of an initialized flag, while secure, can be cumbersome. Simply
  ensuring that all fields in a public non-final class contain a safe
  value (such as null) until object initialization completes
  successfully can represent a reasonable alternative in classes that
  are not security-sensitive.</p>
  
  <p>A more robust, but also more verbose, approach is to use a ""pointer to
  implementation"" (or ""pimpl""). The core of the class is moved into a
  non-public class with the interface class forwarding method calls. Any
  attempts to use the class before it is fully initialized will result
  in a NullPointerException. This approach is also good for dealing with
  clone and deserialization attacks.</p>

<pre><code>    public abstract class ClassLoader {

        private final ClassLoaderImpl impl;

        protected ClassLoader() {
            this.impl = new ClassLoaderImpl();
        }
        protected final Class defineClass(...) {
            return impl.defineClass(...);
        }
    }

    /* pp */ class ClassLoaderImpl {
        /* pp */ ClassLoaderImpl() {
            // permission needed to create ClassLoader
            securityManagerCheck();
            init();
        }

        /* pp */ Class defineClass(...) {
            // regular logic follows

<p>As emphasized, AWS offers the usual escalation option and allows you to submit a <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/elasticbeanstalk-request/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Request to Increase AWS Elastic Beanstalk Limits</a>, if you really need that many application versions to be available for reuse still.

I started clean and copy+pasted the code and repulled Nuget packages and everything just worked. Maybe I overlooked something initially, maybe had a version mismatch, I cannot say. However, I tried adding the dependencies mentioned by Trevor and the problem still existed, so I don't think I was missing anything. </p>
"
46915404,The type initializer for &#39;SQLite.SQLiteConnection&#39; threw an exception,74007173,"<p>Alright, it's been almost five years since you guys asked this question, and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue. I investigated it and found two workarounds. It's worth mentioning that I am using a <strong>.NET MAUI</strong> application and <strong>Visual Studio Community 2022</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, using NuGet packages: If you install the <code>sqlite-net-pcl</code> package with <code>Install-Package sqlite-net-pcl -Version 1.8.116</code> in Visual Studio, it will install its main dependency <code>SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_green</code> using the version <code>2.0.4</code>. Update that package to the latest version (<code>2.1.2</code> as of this writing) with <code>Install-Package SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_green</code>. This process will uninstall the previous version. Now, save the Solution and close Visual Studio. Go to the project's folder and delete the folders <code>bin</code> and <code>obj</code>. Reopen Visual Studio, restore NuGet packages, build, and run.</li>
<li>Second, if the above does not work, uninstall the package <code>sqlite-net-pcl</code>, clone the <code>sqlite-net-pcl</code> GitHub repository (<a href=""https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net</a>), open your project, and add a reference to the <code>SQLite-net-base</code> project. Next, you must initialize a provider using the <code>raw</code> class: <code>SQLitePCL.raw.SetProvider(new SQLitePCL.SQLite3Provider_e_sqlite3());</code>. You must do this in the class that initializes your target platform. For instance, <code>Android</code> defines a <code>MainApplication</code> that inherits the <code>Microsoft.Maui.MauiApplication</code> class. In that <code>MainApplication</code> class, modify the <code>CreateMauiApp()</code> method like so:</li>
</ol>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>using Android.App;
using Android.Runtime;

[Application]
public class MainApplication : MauiApplication
{
    public MainApplication(IntPtr handle, JniHandleOwnership ownership)
        : base(handle, ownership)
    {
    }

    protected override MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        SQLitePCL.raw.SetProvider(new SQLitePCL.SQLite3Provider_e_sqlite3());
        return MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you also use <code>iOS</code> and <code>MacCatalyst</code> (macOS) applications, modify the <code>AppDelegate</code> class like so:</p>
<p>For <code>iOS</code>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>using Foundation;

[Register(&quot;AppDelegate&quot;)]
public class AppDelegate : MauiUIApplicationDelegate
{
    protected override MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        SQLitePCL.raw.SetProvider(new SQLitePCL.SQLite3Provider_sqlite3());
        return MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For <code>MacCatalyst</code>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>using Foundation;

[Register(&quot;AppDelegate&quot;)]
public class AppDelegate : MauiUIApplicationDelegate
{
    protected override MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        SQLitePCL.raw.SetProvider(new SQLitePCL.SQLite3Provider_e_sqlite3());
        return MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to always delete the <code>bin</code> and <code>obj</code> folders.</p>
<p>I hope this helps and good luck!</p>

This target invocation exception is the aftermath of that failure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CsrfViewMiddleware class can be considered an exception, as it

9157210,How do I raise the same Exception with a custom message in Python?,9157277,"<p>Update: <strong>For Python 3, check <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/29442282/42223"">Ben's answer</a></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Update 2023</strong>: I wrote this answer more than ten years ago and there are better answers now. You should be using python 3 and the answer above.</em></p>
<p>Original answer:</p>
<p>To attach a message to the current exception and re-raise it:
(the outer try/except is just to show the effect)</p>
<p>For python 2.x where x&gt;=6:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    try:
      raise ValueError  # something bad...
    except ValueError as err:
      err.message=err.message+&quot; hello&quot;
      raise              # re-raise current exception
except ValueError as e:
    print(&quot; got error of type &quot;+ str(type(e))+&quot; with message &quot; +e.message)
</code></pre>
<p>This will also do the right thing <strong>if <code>err</code> is <em>derived</em></strong> from <code>ValueError</code>. For example <code>UnicodeDecodeError</code>.</p>
<p>Note that you can add whatever you like to <code>err</code>. For example <code>err.problematic_array=[1,2,3]</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> @Ducan points in a comment the above does not work with python 3 since <code>.message</code> is not a member of <code>ValueError</code>. Instead you could use this (valid python 2.6 or later or 3.x):</p>
<pre><code>try:
    try:
      raise ValueError
    except ValueError as err:
       if not err.args: 
           err.args=('',)
       err.args = err.args + (&quot;hello&quot;,)
       raise 
except ValueError as e:
    print(&quot; error was &quot;+ str(type(e))+str(e.args))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit2:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on what the purpose is, you can also opt for adding the extra information under your own variable name. For both python2 and python3:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    try:
      raise ValueError
    except ValueError as err:
       err.extra_info = &quot;hello&quot;
       raise 
except ValueError as e:
    print(&quot; error was &quot;+ str(type(e))+str(e))
    if 'extra_info' in dir(e):
       print e.extra_info
</code></pre>

<p>You need to implement this interface and set your implementation of UncaughtExceptionHandler for a thread by using method setUncaughtExceptionHandler.

<ol>
<li>setUncaughtExceptionHandler</li>
<li>setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler</li>

<p>1) setUncaughtExceptionHandler - This will be a thread specific exception handler. So in case this thread gets terminated by some unhandled exception, this handler will be used.</p>

<p>2) setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler - This will be a default exception handler in case there is no specific uncaught exception handler for a thread.</p>

<p>Example -</p>

  <h2>Catching an exception while using a Python 'with' statement</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>The with statement has been available without the <code>__future__</code> import <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">since Python 2.6</a>. You can get it as <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.5.html#pep-343-the-with-statement"" rel=""noreferrer"">early as Python 2.5</a> (but at this point it's time to upgrade!) with:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import with_statement
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the closest thing to correct that you have. You're almost there, but <code>with</code> doesn't have an <code>except</code> clause:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>with open(""a.txt"") as f: 
    print(f.readlines())
except:                    # &lt;- with doesn't have an except clause.
    print('oops')
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A context manager's <code>__exit__</code> method, if it returns <code>False</code> will reraise the error when it finishes. If it returns <code>True</code>, it will suppress it. The <code>open</code> builtin's <code>__exit__</code> doesn't return <code>True</code>, so you just need to nest it in a try, except block:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    with open(""a.txt"") as f:
        print(f.readlines())
except Exception as error: 
    print('oops')
</code></pre>

<p>And standard boilerplate: don't use a bare <code>except:</code> which catches <code>BaseException</code> and every other possible exception and warning. Be at least as specific as <code>Exception</code>, and for this error, perhaps catch <code>IOError</code>. Only catch errors you're prepared to handle.</p>

<p>So in this case, you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...     with open(""a.txt"") as f:
...         print(f.readlines())
... except IOError as error:

<p>Complete implementation of a custom serializable exception (<code>MySerializableException</code>), and a derived <code>sealed</code> exception (<code>MyDerivedSerializableException</code>).</p>

<p>The main points about this implementation are summarized here:</p>

<ol>
<li>You <strong>must decorate each derived class with the <code>[Serializable]</code> attribute</strong> —
This attribute is not inherited from the base class, and if it is not specified, serialization will fail with a <code>SerializationException</code> stating that <em>""Type X in Assembly Y is not marked as serializable.""</em></li>
<li>You <strong>must implement custom serialization</strong>. The <code>[Serializable]</code> attribute alone is not enough — <code>Exception</code> implements <code>ISerializable</code> which means your derived classes must also implement custom serialization. This involves two steps:

<ol>
<li><strong>Provide a serialization constructor</strong>. This constructor should be <code>private</code> if your class is <code>sealed</code>, otherwise it should be <code>protected</code> to allow access to derived classes.</li>
<li><strong>Override GetObjectData()</strong> and make sure you call through to <code>base.GetObjectData(info, context)</code> at the end, in order to let the base class save its own state.</li>

94488,What is the correct way to make a custom .NET Exception serializable?,94625,"<p>Exception is already serializable, but you need to override the <code>GetObjectData</code> method to store your variables and provide a constructor which can be called when re-hydrating your object.</p>

628408,Custom Exception Messages: Best practices,628579,"<p>I strongly recommend the advice on <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/kcwalina/how-to-design-exception-hierarchies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Krzysztof's blog</a> and would note that in your case you seem to be trying to deal with what he calls Usage Errors.</p>
<p>In this case what is required is not a new type to indicate it but a better error message about what caused it. As such a helper function to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>generate the textual string to place into the exception</li>
<li>generate the whole exception and message</li>
</ol>
<p>Is what is required.</p>
<p>Approach 1 is clearer, but may lead to a little more verbose usage, 2 is the opposite, trading a terser syntax for less clarity.</p>
<p>Note that the functions must be extremely safe (they should never, ever cause an unrelated exception themselves) and not force the provision of data that is optional in certain reasonable uses.</p>
<p>By using either of these approaches you make it easier to internationalise the error message later if required.</p>
<p>A stack trace at a minimum gives you the function, and possibly the line number, thus you should focus on supplying information that is not easy to work out from that.</p>

6121623,Catching exception: divide by zero,6121690,"<p>You will need to check it yourself and throw an exception. Integer divide by zero is not an exception in standard C++. Neither is floating point divide/remainder by zero but at least that has specific rational values that may result (such as the various <code>NaN/Inf</code> values).</p>
<p>The exceptions listed in the <code>[stdexcept.syn]</code> section of <code>ISO C++20</code> standard (the iteration used in this answer) are:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>namespace std {
    class logic_error;
        class domain_error;
        class invalid_argument;
        class length_error;
        class out_of_range;
    class runtime_error;
        class range_error;
        class overflow_error;
        class underflow_error;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now you <em>could</em> argue quite cogently that either <code>overflow_error</code> (the infinity generated by IEEE754 floating point could be considered overflow) or <code>domain_error</code> (it is, after all, a problem with the input value) would be ideal for indicating a divide by zero.</p>
<p>However, section <code>[expr.mul]</code> specifically states (for both integer and floating point division, and integer remainder):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the second operand of <code>/</code> or <code>%</code> is zero, the behavior is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it <em>could</em> throw those (or any other) exceptions. It could also format your hard disk and laugh derisively :-)</p>
<hr />
<p>If you wanted to implement such a beast, you could use something like <code>intDivEx</code> in the following program (using the overflow variant):</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;

// Integer division/remainder, catching divide by zero.

inline int intDivEx (int numerator, int denominator) {
    if (denominator == 0)
        throw std::overflow_error(&quot;Divide by zero exception&quot;);
    return numerator / denominator;
}

inline int intModEx (int numerator, int denominator) {
    if (denominator == 0)
        throw std::overflow_error(&quot;Divide by zero exception&quot;);
    return numerator % denominator;
}

int main (void) {
    int i = 42;

    try {
        i = intDivEx (10, 0);
    } catch (std::overflow_error &amp;e) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; &quot; -&gt; &quot;;
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    try {
        i = intDivEx (10, 2);
    } catch (std::overflow_error &amp;e) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; &quot; -&gt; &quot;;
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}

<p>This outputs:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Divide by zero exception -&gt; 42

6121623,Catching exception: divide by zero,25601100,"<p><strong>Updated with comments from ExcessPhase</strong></p>

<p>GCC (at least version 4.8) will let you emulate this behaviour:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr&lt;void(int)&gt; handler(
        signal(SIGFPE, [](int signum) {throw std::logic_error(""FPE""); }),
        [](__sighandler_t f) { signal(SIGFPE, f); });

    int i = 0;

    std::cin &gt;&gt; i;  // what if someone enters zero?

    try {
        i = 5/i;
    }
    catch (std::logic_error e) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; e.what();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This sets up a new signal handler which throws an exception, and a <code>shared_ptr</code> to the old signal handler, with a custom 'deletion' function that restores the old handler when it goes out of scope.</p>

<p>You need to compile with at least these options:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -c Foo.cc -o Foo.o -fnon-call-exceptions -std=c++11
</code></pre>

<p>Visual C++ will also let you do something similar:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;eh.h&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr&lt;void(unsigned, EXCEPTION_POINTERS*)&gt; handler(
        _set_se_translator([](unsigned u, EXCEPTION_POINTERS* p) {
            switch(u) {
                case FLT_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO:
                case INT_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO:
                    throw std::logic_error(""Divide by zero"");
                    break;
                ...
                default:
                    throw std::logic_error(""SEH exception"");
            }
        }),
        [](_se_translator_function f) { _set_se_translator(f); });

    int i = 0;

    try {
        i = 5 / i;
    } catch(std::logic_error e) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; e.what();

  <p>Stroustrup says, in ""The Design and Evolution of C++"" (Addison Wesley, 1994), ""low-level events, such as arithmetic overflows and divide by zero, are assumed to be handled by a dedicated lower-level mechanism rather than by exceptions. This enables C++ to match the behaviour of other languages when it comes to arithmetic. It also avoids the problems that occur on heavily pipelined architectures where events such as divide by zero are asynchronous.""`</p>

But that makes the use of the built-in <code>Lazy</code> redundant: you'll have unnecessary locks inside the <code>Lazy.Value</code> getter.</p>

34393352,Lazy&lt;T&gt; without exception caching,72579523,"<p>The two existing answers by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/57292231/11178549"">vernou</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/53076076/11178549"">tsul</a> (<code>AtomicLazy&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>SimpleLazy&lt;T&gt;</code> respectively) solve sufficiently this problem, but they both exhibit a behavior that is not entirely to my liking. In case the <code>valueFactory</code> fails, all the threads that are currently in sleep mode waiting for the <code>Value</code>, will retry again the <code>valueFactory</code> one by one. This means that if for example 100 threads request the <code>Value</code> at the same time, and the <code>valueFactory</code> takes 1 second before it fails, the <code>valueFactory</code> will be invoked 100 times, and the last thread in the list will wait for 100 seconds before getting the exception.</p>
<p>A better behavior in my opinion is to propagate the error of the <code>valueFactory</code> to all threads that are currently waiting. This way no thread is going to wait for a response for longer than the duration of a single <code>valueFactory</code> invocation. Below is an implementation of a <code>LazyWithRetry&lt;T&gt;</code> class with this behavior:</p>

/// In case the action is successful, it is never invoked again. In case of failure
/// the error is propagated to the invoking thread, as well as to all other threads
/// that are currently waiting for the result. The error is not cached. The action
/// will be invoked again when the next thread requests the result, repeating the
/// same pattern.

4564559,"Get exception description and stack trace which caused an exception, all as a string",31445046,"<p>Let's create a decently complicated stacktrace, in order to demonstrate that we get the full stacktrace:</p>

def do_something_that_might_error():
    raise_error()

<h2>Logging the full stacktrace</h2>

<p>A best practice is to have a logger set up for your module. It will know the name of the module and be able to change levels (among other attributes, such as handlers)</p>

<pre><code>import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

<p>And we can use this logger to get the error:</p>

<pre><code>try:

    logger.exception(error)

  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 2, in raise_error
RuntimeError: something bad happened!

<h2>Getting just the string</h2>

<p>If you really just want the string, use the <code>traceback.format_exc</code> function instead, demonstrating logging the string here:</p>

<pre><code>import traceback
try:
    do_something_that_might_error()
except Exception as error:

    logger.debug(just_the_string)

43772536,Do you implement your own Exception in Python?,43772787,"<p>Generally, the only times you should be defining your own exceptions are when you have a specific case where raising a custom exception would be more appropriate than raising a existing Python exception.</p>
<p>For example, say I was implementing a command line argument parsing API, and I needed to account for the case where a user enters an invalid command line argument, whatever it may be. Now I <em>could</em> simply raise a Python exception like <code>SyntaxError</code> or a <code>NameError</code>, but that would be a bad design decision.</p>
<p>I want to be able to convey to the user <em>why</em> an exception is being raised, not just that an exception is being raised. A better option would be to subclass the general exception class <code>Exception</code>, and create a specific, custom  exception. Perhaps <code>InvalidCommandLineArgument</code>.</p>
<p>Now instead of having to use a general Python exception, I can use my custom exception which helps to clearly and concisely inform the user of their error.</p>
<p>This can also be useful if you want to be informed when a certain action fails in your code. For instance, if you create a function to download a certian file from the internet, it can raise a <code>NoInternetConnection</code> exception to inform you when the internet connection is down. This allows you to take a certain action based upon that exception being raised.</p>
<p>Now you may wondering why. In the second case you couldn't simply use a conditional statement to <em>test</em> if there was an internet connection before trying to use it. The reason you'd choose the later versus the former is because of the motto in Python that &quot;asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission.&quot; This basically means that it's easier to ask Python to catch an exception if one is thrown, than to try to tiptoe around all possible errors using conditional statements.</p>
<p>In the end, its not about &quot;<em>Do</em> you implement your own Exceptions in Python?&quot;, but &quot;<em>When</em> do you implement your own Exceptions in Python?&quot;</p>

NoDogsOfBreedException  # Sold out of that breed
OwnerHouseCheckException  # We checked your house and it's disgusting. Clean up you slob
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when you <code>import pet_store</code> and <code>pet_store.get_dog(""chihuahua"")</code>, I might throw a <code>NoDogsOfBreedException</code>... because I don't know what you want to do in that case.</p>

<p>Some people might want to try another breed, which wouldn't make sense if only a Chihuahua will satisfy you. Nor would that make sense if I threw an <code>OwnerHouseCheckException</code>. If I say you're house is too dirty for a dog, asking for a different breed won't change my answer. But it's enough information you could take action.</p>

<p>Which is the proper way of things: <strong>let whoever is calling you figure out what to do if an Exception occurs</strong></p>

<p>Maybe you want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retry</li>
<li>Try a different query</li>
<li>Display a message to your user</li>
<li>Spin up a new server</li>
<li>Launch a missile</li>
<li>Release the hounds</li>
</ul>

<p>The point is: <strong>I don't know</strong> what the right thing to do is in your program. And the right thing for you could be different from others. So instead, I'll say ""This is what went wrong, do what you want to do with that info.""</p>

<p>Some programs may fail entirely without internet access (Diablo III) while others can handle being offline (Starcraft). These programs will react differently to a <code>NoInternetException</code>.</p>

<p>2 - You can use the <code>@JsonManagedReference</code> and <code>@JsonBackReference</code> annotations. </p>

<p>If you (the future readers ) are in the same situation, the solution is easier than you expected, simply put @JsonIgnore or @JsonManagedReference / @JsonBackReference <strong>on the attribute's getter</strong> and not on the attribute itself. And that will do.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example how to do so : </p>

<p>Say we have two classes, Order and Product, and OneToMany relation between them.</p>

<p>Order class</p>

<pre><code>public class Order{

  private double price;
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = ""order"")

  private List&lt;Product&gt; products
  //constructor, getters &amp; setter 
  @JsonManagedReference
  public List&lt;Product&gt; getProducts(){
    return products;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Product class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Product{
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
  private String id_product;
  private String name;
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = ""id_order"")

  @JsonBackReference
  public Order getOrder(){

61930799,what is the expected exception in this code? C#,61930878,"<p>You question clearly asks what type of exception <strong>might</strong> occur. That way of phrasing implies that there are different ways the method <code>PrintName</code> might be utilized. And one of the ways is to pass null into <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>So basically your task is to assume all possible use cases of the method and determine what exceptions could be in each case. And you guessed right — it's <code>NullReferenceException</code>.</p>

<p>The idea behind exceptions is to show that program is in a state that it does not know how to continue work or that continuation will cause severe issues. So programmers should always check data (in your case — input params) to verify that particular method can work with input, otherwise the calling side should be notified about errors and work should be stopped — by throwing an exception, for example.</p>
"
61930799,what is the expected exception in this code? C#,61931670,"<p>So, as other answers have mentioned, there is a potential <code>NullReferenceException</code> in this method - if the argument passed to it is a reference to <code>null</code>, that's the exception the run time will throw.</p>

<p><strong>What I want to address is this:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) Modify the above method to handle this specific exception</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So - how should you modify the method?</p>

<p>Let's start with the wrong solution and work our way up:</p>

<p>The wrong solution would be to wrap the <code>Console.WriteLine</code> statement in a <code>try...catch</code>, and catching the <code>NullReferenceException</code>.<br>
This is wrong because you really, really should avoid catching <code>NullReferenceException</code>s.<br>
In fact, you should strive to write your code in such a way that a <code>NullReferenceException</code> will not be a possibility.<br>
Basically, a <code>NullReferenceException</code> is (probably <a href=""https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the most common</a> and easiest to overlook but still) - <a href=""https://ericlippert.com/2008/09/10/vexing-exceptions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a <strong>boneheaded</strong> exception:</a></p>

<pre><code>public static void PrintName(Player p)
{
    try
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(p.Name);
    } 
    // Don't do that!
    catch(NullReferenceException ex)
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(""player is null!"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>A better solution (though probably not in this case) would be to validate your input, and throw an <code>ArgumentNullException</code> if the <code>p</code> argument is null. (btw, terrible name for an argument, but that's a different story).<br>
This way, you wont get a null reference exception but an <code>ArgumentNullException</code> - which is a ""valid"" exception to catch - however, this is useful when writing public APIs, when you don't know in advance who will use your code and how.<br>
Clearly, this is not the case here, and that would also quality as a boneheaded exception (or at least a vexing exception):</p>

<pre><code>public static void PrintName(Player p)
{
    // Better, but still a bad option in this case.
    if(p is null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(p));

    System.Console.WriteLine(p.Name);
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You could check if the reference is not null and only then call <code>Console.WriteLine</code> - and that's a slightly better solution (Don't worry, will get there soon) - but then, how will your user know that the player is null? that gives no indication - simply nothing happens if <code>p</code> is null (Bonus reading: <a href=""https://zoharpeled.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/the-perfect-non-null-test/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The perfect non-null test</a>):</p>

<pre><code>public static void PrintName(Player p)
{
    // This is closer - but how would the user know that p is null?
    if(p is object) 
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(p.Name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>IMHO, the best course of action here is to use a combination of the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operators#null-conditional-operators--and-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">null conditional operator (?.)</a> and the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-coalescing-operator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">null coalescing operator (??)</a>:</p>

<pre><code>public static void PrintName(Player p)
{
    // This is probably the best solution in this case.
    System.Console.WriteLine(p?.Name ?? ""player is null!"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, if <code>p</code> is null, you'll print out <code>""player is null!""</code>, so you avoid the possible <code>NullReferenceException</code>, and your code is still only a single line.</p>

3375810,exception in initializer error in java when using Netbeans,3376348,"<p>@Christian Ullenboom' explanation is correct.</p>

<p>I'm surmising that the <code>OBD2nerForm</code> code you posted is a static initializer block and that it is all generated.  Based on that and on the stack trace, it seems likely that generated code is tripping up because it has found some component of your form that doesn't have the type that it is expecting.</p>

<p>I'd do the following to try and diagnose this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google for reports of similar problems with NetBeans generated forms.</li>
<li>If you are running an old version of NetBeans, scan through the ""bugs fixed"" pages for more recent releases.  Or just upgrade try a newer release anyway to see if that fixes the problem.</li>
<li>Try cutting bits out of the form design until the problem ""goes away"" ... and try to figure out what the real cause is that way.</li>
<li>Run the application under a debugger to figure out what is being (incorrectly) type cast as what.  Just knowing the class names may help.  And looking at the instance variables of the objects may reveal more; e.g. which specific form component is causing the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>My suspicion is that the root cause is a combination of something a bit unusual (or incorrect) with your form design, and bugs in the NetBeans form generator that is not coping with your form.  If you can figure it out, a workaround may reveal itself.</p>

"
72825520,CXX1405 cmake exception while building android project,75888241,"<p>The solution for the CMake error while building your application might be to install Rosetta on your Mac. Rosetta is an emulation technology that allows programs designed for Intel processors to run on a Mac with an M1 or M2 chip. Some programs, such as CMake, may not be natively compatible with the M1 or M2 chip, so you need to install Rosetta to ensure that these programs work correctly.</p>
<p>To install Rosetta, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>softwareupdate --install-rosetta

<p>Once you have installed Rosetta, try building your React Native application again. It should work without encountering the errors you mentioned.</p>

35330620,How to Return Exception from Function in class,35330859,"<p>I think you're missing the point of exceptions. You rarely catch them where they're thrown. The point of exceptions is to let them bubble up. Done <strong>right</strong>, your <code>createFolding()</code> method doesn't need <em>any</em> exception handling <em>or</em> return codes. It simplifies down to this:</p>

<pre><code>public class clsFolding
{
    //no need for this to be public
    private static string ConStr = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""FazalConstructions.Properties.Settings.ConnString""].ConnectionString;

    public static void createFolding(int id, string name, int qty, string narration, DateTime dt)
    {
         string sql = ""INSERT INTO tblFolding(FoldingID, Name,Quantity,Narration,DateTime)VALUES(@id, @name, @qty, @narration,@dt)"";

         //fyi: a static SqlConnection reference is a VERY BAD IDEA
         // use a new variable in each method call
         using(var con = new SqlConnection(ConStr))
         using(var cmd = new SqlCommand(sql, con))
         {
             cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@id"", id);
             cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@name"", name);
             cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@qty"", qty);
             cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@narration"", narration);
             cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@dt"", dt);

             con.Open();
             cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
         }
    }
}

<p>Now you want to show a MessageBox if this fails. That's fine. Do that. It sounds like a good idea. Just <em>do it in the code that calls this method:</em></p>

<pre><code>try 
{
   clsFolding.createFolding( /* parameters here */);
   MessageBox.Show(""Process Successful"", ""Success"", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information);
}
catch (SqlException)
{
    MessageBox.Show(""Process UnSuccessful, could not write to database"", ""Error"", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error); 
}
catch (Exception Ex)
{
    MessageBox.Show(""Process UnSuccessful, a non-database error occured"", ""Error"", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error);

35330620,How to Return Exception from Function in class,35330706,"<p>Create a Model (basically a class with property) which should have an integer and an exception property.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyResult{
    public int Status {get; set;}
    public Exception Exception {get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can return this class from your function like this,</p>

<pre><code>public static MyResult createFolding(int id, string name, int qty, string narration, DateTime dt)
{
    var result = new MyResult();
    try
    {
        // your code
        result.Status = 1;
    }
    catch(Exception e){
        result.Status = 0;
        result.Exception = e;
    }
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So you are expecting <code>MyResult</code> from the function <code>createFolding</code>.</p>

<p>In your code where we call this function should be like this,</p>

<pre><code>var result = clsFoldingObj.createFolding(1,'abhi',1,'empty', new Date());
if(result.Status == 0){
    // result has an exception
    MessageBox.Show(""Process Unsuccessful - ""result.Exception.Message, ""Error"", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error);

35330620,How to Return Exception from Function in class,35330781,"<p>As mentioned in the comments above, it is best practice to throw exceptions rather than returning them. To do this, change the catch part of you sample to the following:</p>

<pre><code>catch (Exception ex)
        {

           throw;

<p>But: to answer your question about how to return multiple values, create a new class, instantiate it with the result values and return that.</p>

<p>The class will have 2 properties: </p>

<pre><code>public class TClass
{
  public int Result { get;set;}
  public Exception Error { get;set;}
}

    {
        try
        {
            con = new SqlConnection(ConStr);

            return new TClass { Result = 1 };
        }
        catch (Exception ex)

23409809,How do you diagnose the exception code 0xc0000409 on Windows?,49781951,"<p>The clue to the problem is in the exception code: 0xc0000409</p>

<p><strong>0xc0000409</strong> means <strong>STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, something in your program is writing past the current stack frame, corrupting data on the stack. The program has detected this and rather than let it continue, has thrown an exception.</p>

<p>How do you debug this? There are a few options:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Rerun this in the debugger and watch it crash, workout what failed.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> If you've got a crash dump of this, load that in the debugger, hit F5 and workout what failed.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> If you don't have a crash dump you can still attempt to find out the cause of the crash if you know the absolute address of the crash (and know the module always loads at a fixed address), or if you know the offset of the crash location from the start of the faulting module. </p>

<p>The crash information above tells you the offset into the faulting module of the crash. That's reported in the Fault Offset field. In your example, that is an offset of 0x0000bd7f. </p>

<p>If you've got the original dll/exe and it's matching PDB, just load it into <a href=""https://www.softwareverify.com/cpp-dbghelp-browser.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">DbgHelpBrowser</a>, go to the <strong>Query</strong> menu, choose <strong>""Find Symbol with DLL Relative Address...""</strong> then enter the offset in the field and click <strong>""Find Symbol...""</strong>. The display will move to show you the nearest matching symbol, highlighting the symbol and display any info about parameters, line numbers and source code. </p>

<p>It's a free tool. You can get it here:

<p>If you really want to avoid it, I suggest you disable settings like ""Enable .NET framework source stepping"" under TOOLS->Options->Debugging.</p>

<p>To debug .NET framework source code,we need to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disable just my code</p>
  
  <p>Disable step over properties and operators</p>
  
  <p>Disable require source files to exactly match the original version</p>
  
  <p>Enable .NET framework source stepping</p>
  
  <p>Enable source server support</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So just use the contrary settings as above options, debug it again.</p>

<p>In addition, please enable the symbols server under TOOLS->Options->Debugging->Symbols Server, and enable the exception settings window, view the detailed exception messages, maybe you have to resolve the Exception firstly or get any helpful information from it.</p>

76157250,Am getting index out of bounds exception in my code,76158622,"<p>You declare x, let it be incremented until it is equal to the length of the array, then pass it into a function where you use it to index the array again, but now the number inside it is greater than any valid index of the array. So it blows up with an IndexOutOfBoundsException.</p>
<p>So the immediate problem is you didn't have a reasonable value in this variable when you used it to index the array. But the big picture is: it's time to learn about controlling complexity because you are well on the way to creating things that are too hard for you to reason about.</p>
<p>Your best tools for controlling complexity are 1) limiting the scope of your variables and 2) writing cohesive methods, that means  methods that do only one well-defined thing.</p>
<p>Your variable x has no good reason to be defined outside of the for loop, you can change it to look like this so that it is defined only inside of the loop:</p>
<pre><code>for (int x = 0; x &lt; N; x++) {
    arr[x] = input.nextInt();
}

<p>This way x has one and only one job, when x has done its job you don't have to worry about it anymore, you are rid of it.</p>
<p>There is no reason to pass x in to the AVER method that I can see. You can use arr.length to find the number of elements in arr. If you do need another variable in the AVER method, make one that is local to AVER. You're not saving anything by passing x around, you're just causing yourself trouble.</p>
<p>Change AVER to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>pass in as parameters only the array you want the average of, and nothing else,</p>
</li>
<li><p>return the result of averaging the values of the array, instead of returning void (this makes it clear what are the inputs and what is the output), and</p>
</li>
<li><p>remove all the stuff that has nothing to do with calculating an average and put it elsewhere, like in a separate static method that counts negative numbers (and does nothing else).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In prior versions of the .NET
  Framework, your application could
  catch a StackOverflowException object
  (for example, to recover from
  unbounded recursion). However, that
  practice is currently discouraged
  because significant additional code is
  required to reliably catch a stack
  overflow exception and continue
  program execution. </p>
  
  <p>Starting with the .NET Framework
  version 2.0, a StackOverflowException
  object cannot be caught by a try-catch
  block and the corresponding process is
  terminated by default. Consequently,
  users are advised to write their code
  to detect and prevent a stack
  overflow. For example, if your
  application depends on recursion, use
  a counter or a state condition to
  terminate the recursive loop. Note
  that an application that hosts the
  common language runtime (CLR) can
  specify that the CLR unload the
  application domain where the stack
  overflow exception occurs and let the
  corresponding process continue. For
  more information, see
  ICLRPolicyManager Interface and
  Hosting the Common Language Runtime.</p>

"
76091367,How to manage the Exception thrown from some particular subclasses in Java?,76091623,"<p>There are many solutions, and usually you should apply or at least think about <strong>all</strong> of these:</p>
<h2>Liskov's substition principle</h2>
<p>If the <code>Vehicle</code> class/interface declares that you can ask a vehicle to accelerate, then <em>all vehicles ought to support this except in extremely exotic circumstances</em>. This is called Liskov's substitution principle (the idea being that if you define some algorithm where as part of the input you need some sort of <code>Vehicle</code>, then LSP says I should be able to take your spec, replace <code>Vehicle</code> with some subtype of it, such as <code>Train</code>, and the algorithm still needs to make sense: You must always be able to substitute a parent type with a subtype.</p>
<p>As a consequence, <strong><code>Vehicle</code> should not have <code>accelerate</code> at all</strong>. If not all vehicles can do it, then it's not part of <code>Vehicle</code>. You may want to introduce a new interface that captures the notion of a vehicle whose speeds <em>can</em> change, which e.g. <code>Car</code> and <code>Bicycle</code> implement, but <code>Train</code> does not. <code>accelerate</code> should be in that interface.</p>
<p>There is now no need for <code>TrainSpeedChangeException</code> - because the <code>Train</code> class isn't going to have an <code>accelerate</code> method <em>at all</em>.</p>
<p>You're falling afoul of these rules when you write an implementation of a method whose body consists solely of a single <code>throw</code> clause.</p>
<p>Note that the JVM/java core libs themselves don't fully follow this: It's not a law, it's a principle. For example, immutable lists still have an <code>add</code> method whose body simply <code>throw new UnsupportedOperationException()</code></p>
<h2>The relationship between checked and unchecked exceptions</h2>
<p>If it is plausible that a certain exception cannot occur unless a bug has been programmed, then <strong>that should never be a checked exception</strong>. The reason should be obvious - if you want to 'catch' bugs, then obviously you have to catch the runtimeexceptions (just about every -caused-by-bug- exception the JVM itself throws as runtimeexceptions, such as NullPointerException). Having to write <code>catch (SomeExceptionThatCannotOccurUnlessBugs)</code> everywhere is pointless, and what do you put in the catch block anyway? A log statement? A runtime exception that bubbles up the top results in that anyway, or if it doesn't, you have bigger problems.</p>
<p>The Java core libs itself do apply this rule: <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> is a RuntimeException (meaning, you don't need to declare it in your <code>throws</code> clauses).</p>
<h2>exception hierarchies</h2>
<p>Whenever you grow a cavalcade of checked exceptions, it is virtually always correct to introduce a type in the type hierarchy to cover all of it. The core libs do this too - the security (cryptography)-related APIs have a ton of checked exceptions (key is in the wrong format, that algorithm does not exist, the input doesn't fit the expected format, and so on), and they <em>all</em> <code>extends GeneralSecurityException</code> so that code that wants to react to some sort of problem with the config of the crypto but not any <em>particular</em> problem, can simply catch GSE.</p>
<p>IOExceptions are the same way. There's exception types to cover 'that file does not exist', 'this process does not have the required access rights to do that', 'the disk is full', 'that channel is already closed', 'the other side hung up', 'the entire network card went offline', and a hundred more such specifics, and they <em>all</em> are declared as e.g. <code>public class NoSuchFileException extends IOException {}</code> so that you can choose: If you want to specifically detect file-not-found, catch NSFEx, if you want to have a fallback handler for any I/O problem, catch the more general IOEx.</p>
<h2>Some closing notes</h2>
<p>Exceptions that ever show up in a log are generally <em>always</em> a dire situation. Therefore, by convention, <strong>do not</strong> make exception messages all caps, and <strong>do not</strong> include punctuation at the end of them. <em>Especially</em> exclamation points. Don't do that.</p>
<p>You can catch multiple exception types in one catch:</p>
<pre><code>try {
 ...
} catch (ExceedSpeedLimit | NotEnoughSpeed e) {
  throw e;
} ...
</code></pre>
<p>.. not that you still need this construct if you apply the rules above.</p>
<p>Also, exceptions by convention end in the word <code>Exception</code>. (And anything that extends <code>Error</code>  ends in <code>Error</code>. Don't let anything extend <code>Throwable</code> directly unless they do not convey the notion of errors or extraordinary exits of methods but are instead low-level control flow constructs, which you should almost never do (using throwables for control flow is usually a bad idea), but if you must - extend <code>Throwable</code> and there are no particular rules about what such types should use for names.</p>
"
76091367,How to manage the Exception thrown from some particular subclasses in Java?,76091549,"<p>One way to solve this problem is to change <em>TrainSpeedChange</em> to an unchecked exception. This way the exception doesn't need to be propagated and the signature of <em>accelerate(int amount)</em> within <em>Vehicle</em> doesn't need to be changed.</p>
<p>This is, in my opion, the cleanest solution, because in its essence <em>TrainSpeedChange</em> exception is the equivalent to the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UnsupportedOperationException</a></p>
"
76091367,How to manage the Exception thrown from some particular subclasses in Java?,76091628,"<p>You may introduce a common Exception type,</p>
<pre><code>class AccelerationException extends Exception {}
</code></pre>
<p>and then subclass the other exceptions from that.</p>
<pre><code>class ExceedSpeedLimit extends AccelerationException {}
class NotEnoughSpeed extends AccelerationException {}
class TrainSpeedChange extends AccelerationException {}
</code></pre>
<p>You can then declare <code>accelerate</code> to throw the super type.</p>
<pre><code>class Vehicle {
  public int accelerate (int amount) throws AccelerationException { ...}
</code></pre>
<p>and all `accelerate()´-overrides are allowed to throw a subclass exception.</p>
<p>You can then catch either specific exceptions</p>
<pre><code>public int accelerate(int amount) throws ExceedSpeedLimit, NotEnoughSpeed {
 try {
   //call super class method to meet potential exceptions
   super.accelerate(amount);
   } catch (ExceedSpeedLimit | NotEnoughSpeed e) {
     throw e;
   } catch (AccelerationException e) {
     // should not happen because the super class doesn't throw other exceptions
     System.out.println(&quot;BUG! THIS MUST NEVER HAPPEN!&quot;);
   }
   return getSpeed();
 }
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>catch</code>-clauses are evaluated in order.</p>
<p>In fact, if you do it this way, you don't need to catch an exception in the first place, because you know exactly what exceptions are thrown from the hierarchy.</p>
<p>As rzwitserloot notes, it isn't exactly great to provide a method that doesn't get implemented in subclasses; if you do this, you may be better off using <code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code> which is what the JDK throws in these situations (an unchecked Exception).</p>

524062,LinqToSQl and the Member access not legal on type exception,525527,"<p>I think the problem is the 'let' statement in GetGigs. Using 'let' means that you define a part of the final query separately from the main set to fetch. the problem is that 'let', if it's not a scalar, results in a nested query. Nested queries are not really Linq to sql's strongest point as they're executed deferred as well. In your query, you place the results of the nested query into the projection of the main set to return which is then further appended with linq operators. </p>

<p>When THAT happens, the nested query is buried deeper into the query which will be executed, and this leads to a situation where the nested query isn't in the outer projection of the query to execute and thus has to be merged into the SQL query ran onto the DB. This is not doable, as it's a nested query in a projection nested inside the main sql query and SQL doesn't have a concept like 'nested query in a projection', as you can't fetch a set of elements inside a projection in SQL, only scalars. </p>
"
524062,LinqToSQl and the Member access not legal on type exception,4025517,"<p>I had the same issue and what seemed to do the trick for me was separating out an inline static method call that returned IQueryable&lt;> so that I stored this deferred query into a variable and referenced that. </p>

<p>I think this is a bug in Linq to SQL but at least there is a reasonable workaround. I haven't tested this out yet but my assumption is that this problem may arise only when referencing static methods of a different class within a query expression regardless of whether the return type of that function is IQueryable&lt;>. So maybe it's the class that holds the method that is at the root of the problem. Like I said, I haven't been able to confirm this but it may be worth investigating.</p>

47015693,How to fix &quot;&#39;throw&#39; of exception caught locally&quot;?,59278422,"<p>Contrary to James Thorpe's opinion, I slightly prefer the pattern of throwing. I don't see any compelling reason to treat local errors in the try block any differently from errors that bubble up from deeper in the call stack... just throw them. In my opinion, this is a better application of consistency.</p>

<p>Because this pattern is more consistent, it naturally lends itself better to refactoring when you want to extract logic in the try block to another function that is perhaps in another module/file.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// main.js
try {
  if (!data) throw Error('missing data')
} catch (error) {
  handleError(error)
}

// Refactor...

// validate.js
function checkData(data) {
  if (!data) throw Error('missing data')
}

// main.js
try {
  checkData(data)
} catch (error) {
  handleError(error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>If instead of throwing in the try block you handle the error, then the logic has to change if you refactor it outside of the try block.</p>

<p>In addition, handling the error has the drawback of making you remember to return early so that the try block doesn't continue to execute logic after the error is encountered. This can be quite easy to forget.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>try {
  if (!data) {
    handleError(error)
    return // if you forget this, you might execute code you didn't mean to. this isn't a problem with throw.
  }
  // more logic down here
} catch (error) {
  handleError(error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you're concerned about which method is more performant, you shouldn't be. Handling the error is technically more performant, but the difference between the two is absolutely trivial.</p>

<p>Consider the possibility that WebStorm is a bit too opinionated here. ESLint doesn't even have a rule for this. Either pattern is completely valid.</p>

<p>No, as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48773/adding-extra-information-to-a-custom-exception#48792"">Sören already pointed out</a>.

<p>The key point here is that <code>e</code> is evaluated lazily, only when it is being printed, so we observe <code>*** Exception:</code> in front of it.</p>
<p>For the last question, note that <code>until (const False) f x</code> will never evaluate any <code>f (f (f ... (f x))</code>.

<p>Further down the file instead of seeing <strong>dependentAssembly</strong> elements for assemblies some of the assemblies were listed as plain content files (<strong>file</strong> elements).</p>

<p>These problems certainly make the ClickOnce deployment invalid, and the cause was using a version of <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/acz3y3te%28v=vs.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Mage</a> that was compiled against an older version of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework"" rel=""nofollow"">.NET</a> than the assemblies it was trying to create manifests for.

<p>Since the array is zero-based, the &quot;less than or equal to&quot; actually creates 11 iterations of the loop when we only have 10. We only have 10 characters or iterations, we cannot have 11. The first iteration value is &quot;H&quot; at array position 0 <code>str[0]</code> hence declaring <code>i = 0;</code></p>
<p>The last value is &quot;d&quot; at array position 9 <code>str[9]</code> at iteration 10. Position 10, on iteration 11, <code>str[10]</code> does not exist. It is out of bounds of the array.</p>
<p>You actually want <code>i &lt; 10</code> which would be <code>i &lt; word.length</code>. Again, we want to stop at 1 short of 10 because the array is Zero-based.</p>

So you should use a less-than sign (<code>&lt;</code>) in the <code>for</code> loop, and not a less-than-or-equal (<code>&lt;=</code>).</p>

"
633944,What exception to throw from a property setter?,634021,"<p>I wouldn't throw an exception at all. Rather I would allow a string of any length and then have a separate &quot;Validate&quot; method on the class that is called before saving. There are a number of scenarios particularly if you use databinding where throwing exceptions from property setters can get you in a mess.</p>
<p>When data binding it is recommended to implement the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.idataerrorinfo?view=net-7.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IDataErrorInfo</a> interface. This has an <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.idataerrorinfo.error?view=net-7.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Error</a> property that gives the overall description of what is wrong with the object's properties and an <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.idataerrorinfo.item?view=net-7.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Item[columnName]</a> property that give the details of what is wrong specifically with each property.</p>
<p>The trouble with throwing exceptions from property setters is that programmers forget to catch them. It kind of depends upon how clean you expect the data you are getting to be. In this case I would expect long string lengths to be common not exceptional and as such using an exception would be &quot;flow control with exceptions&quot;.</p>
<p>To quote from the Microsoft's <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229030.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Design Guidelines for Developing Class Libraries</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not use exceptions for normal flow
of control, if possible. Except for
system failures and operations with
potential race conditions, framework
designers should design APIs so that
users can write code that does not
throw exceptions. For example, you can
provide a way to check preconditions
before calling a member so that users
can write code that does not throw
exceptions.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a perfect fix to this bug. However, I came across a somewhat good workaround on <a href=""https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/44431#issuecomment-619482424"" rel=""noreferrer"">Github</a>.</p>

<p>It requires you to edit <code>package:flutter/src/services/platform_channel.dart</code>.</p>

<p>You would have to wrap this 👇🏽</p>

<pre><code>final Map&lt;dynamic, dynamic&gt; result = await invokeMethod&lt;Map&lt;dynamic, dynamic&gt;&gt;(method, arguments);
return result?.cast&lt;K, V&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>with a <code>try/catch</code> block as follows 👇🏽 (found at the beginning of <code>invokeMapMethod</code>)</p>

<pre><code>try {
    final Map&lt;dynamic, dynamic&gt; result = await invokeMethod&lt;Map&lt;dynamic, dynamic&gt;&gt;(method, arguments);
    return result?.cast&lt;K, V&gt;();
} on PlatformException catch (err) { // Checks for type PlatformException
    if (err.code == 'sign_in_canceled') { // Checks for sign_in_canceled exception
        print(err.toString());
    } else {
        throw err; // Throws PlatformException again because it wasn't the one we wanted
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to check if <code>googleSignInAccount</code> is <code>null</code> in which case, you should return <code>return null</code> to prevent further exceptions like <code>NoSuchMethodError: The getter 'authentication' was called on null</code></p>

<p>So, your code can be re-written as</p>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>final GoogleSignInAccount googleSignInAccount = await googleSignIn.signIn().catchError((onError) =&gt; print(onError));

// Return null to prevent further exceptions if googleSignInAccount is null
if (googleSignInAccount == null) return null;

final GoogleSignInAuthentication googleSignInAuthentication = await googleSignInAccount.authentication;

<p>...</p>

7125352,Try/Catch exception continue from line that caused the exception,7125806,"<blockquote>
  <p>When an exception is thrown, how can I catch it and then continue execution starting from the line that caused the error? (Not the next line; retry the line that caused the exception.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not try to do that. You're approaching this problem from the wrong direction. </p>

<p>The problem is that you have an unreliable subsystem. You have a desired policy for dealing with that unreliable subsystem, which is to retry the operation until it succeeds. If that's the case then don't put that logic <em>in the line-of-business code which uses the subsystem</em>. The line-of-business code should be about the business logic, not about the mechanism you choose to deal with the flaky subsystem. <strong>Isolate the mechanism to a specific class which makes the unreliable subsystem into a reliable subsystem.</strong></p>

<p>That is, build a <em>proxy class</em> that has the same interface as the unreliable subsystem, and isolate your retry logic into that proxy class. Then the line-of-business code can use the proxy class as a reliable subsystem.</p>

<p>That said, a policy of ""retry it until it works"" is possibly a bad policy. If the subsystem is genuinely broken and not just flaky in some transient way, then ""retry until it works"" means ""wait forever"", and most users do not like waiting forever. For example, if the exception is a result of a router being unplugged rather than some transient condition then sitting there in a loop until someone plugs the router back in seems like a bad idea.</p>

The former will clutter your code quite a bit, while the latter could end up taking a lot more time than you think (since its often a better idea to simply alert the user if something unexpected occurs.

53825596,Using RunOnUIThread causing null pointer Exception After Switching to another Fragment,53826913,"<p>The first, you should understand about threads in Android. In Android, we have a thread called MainUIThread. I'm not sure that's the main thread or not. However, It has an instance of <code>Looper</code> class.</p>

<p>Your fragment source basically runs on MainUIThread by default. When you create the sub-class of <code>TimerTask</code>, you are creating a new Runnable for run your source in another thread, is that right?</p>

<p>Your error message <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code> means that the return value of <code>getActivity()</code> method are <code>null</code>. A good place to start is the JavaDocs. They have this covered:</p>

<p>Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calling the instance method of a null object.</li>
<li>Accessing or modifying the field of a null object.</li>
<li>Taking the length of null as if it were an array.</li>
<li>Accessing or modifying the slots of null as if it were an array.</li>
<li>Throwing null as if it were a Throwable value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications should throw instances of this class to indicate other illegal uses of the null object.</p>

<p>The solution for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Let check and make sure you are not finishing the Activity. (Another case that's you detach this Fragment of called Activity. Because you are using ViewPager, I guess that you are swipe two times to left or right. It automatically detach your fragment by default) Try to abandon it.</li>

67476856,Fatal Exception: android.content.ActivityNotFoundException: No Activity found to handle Intent,67485825,"<p>A few notes on this issue:</p>
<h2>Detecting non-browser apps as browsers</h2>
<p>They query for browsers can detect non-browser applications, which will lead the an <code>ActivityNotFoundException</code> when launching the Custom Tab. See <a href=""https://github.com/GoogleChrome/android-browser-helper/issues/89"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this issue</a> for an example.</p>
<p>When querying for packages that can handle browser intents, I recommend using the below:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>
Intent browserIntent = new Intent()
        .setAction(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
        .addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_BROWSABLE)
        .setData(Uri.fromParts(&quot;http&quot;, &quot;&quot;, null));
</code></pre>
<p>This is also how the <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/Permission/PermissionController/src/com/android/permissioncontroller/role/model/BrowserRoleBehavior.java;l=47-50?q=BrowserRoleBehavior&amp;ss=android%2Fplatform%2Fsuperproject"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Android framework itself detects browsers</a>.</p>
<p>The following shouldn't be a problem as the the Custom Tab will still work, but the behaviour of <code>PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY</code> changed on Android M and only the default browser is returned - I'm not sure what happens if a default browser is not set, but this may mean the returned list will be empty instead. This will mean users will get the disambiguation dialog when a default browser is not set. From Android M and above you may also want additionally query the package manager using <code>PackageManager.MATCH_ALL</code> if you want to get all browsers avoid the disambiguation dialog.</p>
<p>Check out <a href=""https://github.com/andreban/android-browser-helper/blob/e0fd36cbf4f2d7e77616981568dd614b25be177d/androidbrowserhelper/src/main/java/com/google/androidbrowserhelper/trusted/TwaProviderPicker.java#L103-L172"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this snippet</a> in the <code>android-browser-helper</code> library for detecting Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activity.</p>
<h2>Preparing for Android 11</h2>
<p>Android 11 introduced <a href=""https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/package-visibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">package visibility</a> and applications must now declare which packages they are querying for. If your application is not implementing this, the list returned when querying the package manage will be empty, even with a browser installed.</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
    possibleProviders.addAll(pm.queryIntentActivities(queryBrowsersIntent,
                    PackageManager.MATCH_ALL));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this shouldn't cause an <code>ActivityNotFoundException</code> as it would just cause the Custom Tab to launch without a package set.</p>
<h2>Disabled browsers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Before I upgraded to custom-tabs in the live version, I used following code to open url but I always get the ActivityNotFoundException:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>Intent browserIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri);
startActivity(browserIntent);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible for users to disable all browser applications, but I wouldn't expect this to be common.</p>

12271064,Bad Sql Grammar exception in JDBC spring,36180085,"<p>I know this is an old thread, but hopefully anyone stumbling across this question will find this answer useful.</p>

<p>I was getting the same exception in my spring app.  Based on the output, I thought I had a syntax issue with my query.  It turns out that I actually had a syntax error in my mapper method.  I came across this issue because I originally created my Product class with different field names than the column names.</p>

<pre><code>public class ProductMapper implements RowMapper&lt;Product&gt; {
public Product mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
  Product product = new Product();
  product.setProduct_id(rs.getInt(""product_id""));  //was id.  was causing BadSqlGrammarException
  product.setProduct_name(rs.getString(""product_name"")); //was name.  was causing BadSqlGrammarException
  product.setPrice(rs.getDouble(""price""));
  product.setQuantity(rs.getInt(""quantity""));
  return product;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once I made the above changes (my fields are named product_id and product_name), my app worked correctly.  Just remember that any changes you make to column names or java fields should be made not only to your query statements, but also to your mapper method as well.  I see that the OP did this correctly, but I thought it was worth reiterating.  I hope someone finds this helpful.</p>

<p>The Lambda function must exit with an error in order for the response pattern to be evaluated – it is not possible to “fake” an error response by simply returning an “errorMessage” field in a successful Lambda response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/error-handling-patterns-in-amazon-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Error Handling Patterns in Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda</a></p>
"
45108530,Is there any way to signal an error in AWS Lambda for Java without throwing an exception?,57542494,"<p>It is more of a generic question rather than Java-related as AWS API Gateway integration has nothing much to do with the language in which AWS Lambda function is written.</p>

<p>You can achieve returning custom error message by following the guidelines from the AWS documentation here: <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/handle-errors-in-lambda-integration.html#handle-custom-errors-in-lambda-integration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Handle Custom Lambda Errors in API Gateway</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Lambda custom integrations, you must map errors returned by Lambda in the integration response to standard HTTP error responses for your clients. Otherwise, Lambda errors are returned as 200 OK responses by default and the result is not intuitive for your API users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two types of errors that Lambda can return: </p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/handle-errors-in-lambda-integration.html#handle-standard-errors-in-lambda-integration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Standard Errors</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/handle-errors-in-lambda-integration.html#handle-custom-errors-in-lambda-integration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Custom Errors</a></li>
</ol>

<p>In your API, you must handle these differently.</p>

<p>With the Lambda proxy integration, Lambda is required to return an output of the following format:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""isBase64Encoded"" : ""boolean"",
  ""statusCode"": ""number"",
  ""headers"": { ... },
  ""body"": ""JSON string""
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this output, statusCode is typically 4XX for a client error and 5XX for a server error. API Gateway handles these errors by mapping the Lambda error to an HTTP error response, according to the specified statusCode. For API Gateway to pass the error type (for example, InvalidParameterException), as part of the response to the client, the Lambda function must include a header (for example, ""X-Amzn-ErrorType"":""InvalidParameterException"") in the headers property.</p>

<p>For more details, check out this official document from AWS here: <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/handle-errors-in-lambda-integration.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Handle Lambda Errors in API Gateway</a></p>
"
45108530,Is there any way to signal an error in AWS Lambda for Java without throwing an exception?,57568026,"<p>I think this is more a design question rather than a Java/AWS question. </p>

<p>The intended design of AWS lambda is ... when your code has internal problems, it will return 500 (the ugly ones) while if the client is trying to reach something that's not there (400 or 300). This is true regardless of framework (same for Java Spring and Python Django etc.)</p>

<p>If your function is nicely detecting an error and returning a perfect object (json), then it is (by definition) not an internal problems of your code. In other words, your code is functioning as intended. As far as lambda is concerned, it is 200 ok. </p>

<p>If you want ugly response (5xx), you need to throw an error/exception. Else, lambda will think your code is fine and whatever error you are throwing inside your json is normal payload. It is not to say you should not encode your error in json response. It is perfectly normal to include application-specific/business-logic driven errors to pass in payload like this. </p>

<p>I hope this answer your question. In short, </p>

<p>there is no other way to have lambda return 5xx than throwing an error and 
it is intended behavior.</p>

6143929,How do I not log a particular type of Exception in Logback?,38840806,"<p>This question is 5 years old, but I'm supplying the solution I found just to keep it up to date.</p>

<p>I found a solution in the offical docs:
<a href=""http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html</a></p>

<p>For my particular situation, which is a 17 year old web site running plain old servlets (ah, the days), the servlet is now throwing an exception if the user was not logged in.  So here's my code snippets:</p>

<p><strong>Servlet</strong></p>

<pre><code>  try {
    InvalidLoginException.throwIfBadLogin(webUser);

    // main logic here

  } catch (InvalidLoginException e) {
    throw e;
  } catch (Throwable t) {
    log.error(t);
    throw new UnhandledException(t);
  }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>web.xml</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;error-page&gt;
    &lt;exception-type&gt;com.mycompany.servlet.exception.InvalidLoginException&lt;/exception-type&gt;
    &lt;location&gt;/servlet/Login&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;/error-page&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>From the setup above, I didn't want to log this exception as it's not <em>really</em> an exception, but rather a break in logic to redirect to login.</p>

<p>So, the start of my <strong>logback.xml</strong> file is this:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;configuration packagingData=""true"" scan=""true"" debug=""true"" scanPeriod=""30 seconds""&gt;
    &lt;evaluator name=""InvalidLoginExceptionSuppressor""&gt;
      &lt;expression&gt;throwable != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; throwable instanceof com.mycompany.servlet.exception.InvalidLoginException&lt;/expression&gt;
    &lt;/evaluator&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and further down in the logback.xml file, my appenders:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;appender name=""STDOUT"" class=""ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender""&gt;
    &lt;encoder&gt;
      &lt;pattern&gt;%d{MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg %ex{full,InvalidLoginExceptionSuppressor}%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
      &lt;immediateFlush&gt;false&lt;/immediateFlush&gt;
    &lt;/encoder&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Also note, in order to this work, I had to include <a href=""http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.codehaus.janino/janino"" rel=""nofollow"">janino</a> to handle the expression parsing.</p>

<p>Justification:</p>
<p>J provided a nice answer, but I don't like class helpers because if you have more than one class helper for the same class, the only one will be used. The process is almost &quot;by dice&quot;: the order of the units in the &quot;uses&quot; clause determine which helper will apply. I don't like this amount of randomness in a programming language.</p>

1508467,Log exception with traceback in Python,9929970,"<p>My job recently tasked me with logging all the tracebacks/exceptions from our application. I tried numerous techniques that others had posted online such as the one above but settled on a different approach. Overriding <code>traceback.print_exception</code>. </p>

<p>I have a write up at <a href=""http://www.bbarrows.com/blog/2012/09/24/implementing-exception-logging-in-python/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.bbarrows.com/</a> That would be much easier to read but Ill paste it in here as well.</p>

<p>When tasked with logging all the exceptions that our software might encounter in the wild I tried a number of different techniques to log our python exception tracebacks. At first I thought that the python system exception hook, sys.excepthook would be the perfect place to insert the logging code. I was trying something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>import traceback
import StringIO
import logging
import os, sys

def my_excepthook(excType, excValue, traceback, logger=logger):
    logger.error(""Logging an uncaught exception"",
                 exc_info=(excType, excValue, traceback))

sys.excepthook = my_excepthook  
</code></pre>

<p>This worked for the main thread but I soon found that the my sys.excepthook would not exist across any new threads my process started. This is a huge issue because most everything happens in threads in this project.</p>

<p>After googling and reading plenty of documentation the most helpful information I found was from the Python Issue tracker.</p>

<p>The first post on the thread shows a working example of the <code>sys.excepthook</code> NOT persisting across threads (as shown below). Apparently this is expected behavior.</p>

<pre><code>import sys, threading

def log_exception(*args):
    print 'got exception %s' % (args,)
sys.excepthook = log_exception

def foo():
    a = 1 / 0

threading.Thread(target=foo).start()
</code></pre>

<p>The messages on this Python Issue thread really result in 2 suggested hacks. Either subclass <code>Thread</code> and wrap the run method in our own try except block in order to catch and log exceptions or monkey patch <code>threading.Thread.run</code> to run in your own try except block and log the exceptions.</p>

<p>The first method of subclassing <code>Thread</code> seems to me to be less elegant in your code as you would have to import and use your custom <code>Thread</code> class EVERYWHERE you wanted to have a logging thread. This ended up being a hassle because I had to search our entire code base and replace all normal <code>Threads</code> with this custom <code>Thread</code>. However, it was clear as to what this <code>Thread</code> was doing and would be easier for someone to diagnose and debug if something went wrong with the custom logging code. A custome logging thread might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class TracebackLoggingThread(threading.Thread):
    def run(self):
        try:
            super(TracebackLoggingThread, self).run()
        except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
            raise
        except Exception, e:
            logger = logging.getLogger('')
            logger.exception(""Logging an uncaught exception"")
</code></pre>

<p>The second method of monkey patching <code>threading.Thread.run</code> is nice because I could just run it once right after <code>__main__</code> and instrument my logging code in all exceptions. Monkey patching can be annoying to debug though as it changes the expected functionality of something. The suggested patch from the Python Issue tracker was:</p>

<p>It was not until I started testing my exception logging I realized that I was going about it all wrong.</p>

<p>To test I had placed a</p>

<pre><code>raise Exception(""Test"")
</code></pre>

<p>somewhere in my code. However, wrapping a a method that called this method was a try except block that printed out the traceback and swallowed the exception. This was very frustrating because I saw the traceback bring printed to STDOUT but not being logged. It was I then decided that a much easier method of logging the tracebacks was just to monkey patch the method that all python code uses to print the tracebacks themselves, traceback.print_exception.
I ended up with something similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>def add_custom_print_exception():
    old_print_exception = traceback.print_exception
    def custom_print_exception(etype, value, tb, limit=None, file=None):
        tb_output = StringIO.StringIO()
        traceback.print_tb(tb, limit, tb_output)
        logger = logging.getLogger('customLogger')
        logger.error(tb_output.getvalue())
        tb_output.close()
        old_print_exception(etype, value, tb, limit=None, file=None)
    traceback.print_exception = custom_print_exception
</code></pre>

<p>This code writes the traceback to a String Buffer and logs it to logging ERROR. I have a custom logging handler set up the 'customLogger' logger which takes the ERROR level logs and send them home for analysis.</p>

61788265,Using ` LinkedBlockingQueue` may cause null pointer exception,61788421,"<p>You are correct that <code>last</code> is equal to a <code>node</code> with a <code>null</code> value. However this is intentional. The <code>lock</code> is only meant to ensure that each thread can perform modifications in this class correctly. </p>

<p>Sometimes using <code>null</code> values is intentional, to indicate a lack of value (empty queue in this case). Because the variable is <code>private</code> it can only be modified from within the class, so as long as the one writing the class is aware of the possibility of <code>null</code>, everything is alright.</p>

<p>I think you are confusing multiple different concepts which are not necessarily connected. Note that because <code>last</code> is <code>private</code> there is no publication. In addition <code>head</code> and <code>last</code> are meant to be modified, so they can't be <code>final</code>.</p>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>Perhaps I misunderstood your question...</p>

<p><code>null</code> is never assigned to <code>last</code> directly. So the only place this could happen is in the constructor, before <code>last</code> is assigned <code>new Node&lt;E&gt;(null)</code>. Although we can be sure that the constructor finishes before it is used by many threads, there is no visibility guarantee for the values. </p>

<p>However <code>put</code> uses a <code>lock</code> which does guarantees visibility in use. So if there was no <code>lock</code> used, then <code>last</code> could actually be <code>null</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>a <code>std::string</code> and <code>+</code></li>
<li>a <code>std::ostringstream</code></li>
<li>a char buffer and perhaps <code>strcat</code> and/or <code>sprintf()</code></li>

// not thread-safe
static char buf...

<p><strong>SOLUTION 1:</strong>
By creating an ErrorController and implementing a method for the /error servlet mapping path. Inside, you can create and return your ResponseEntity already, or, in my case, I chose to throw an instance of my custom PathNotFoundException, so that later I could catch its event at my @AdviceController @ExceptionHandler method and mount my response payload data there. The disadvantage to this solution is that you can't get the path the user tried to access from the HttpServletRequest, as the path available will be the intermediate &quot;/error&quot; path from the ErrorController and not the original path the user tried to get any resources from. But, at least, with this solution, you can catch the exception event (at the ErrorController) and direct the flux to your custom handler to create and return a custom ResponseEntity and payload data from there.</p>

.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
<strong>SOLUTION 2:</strong>
This is the best solution.
For avoiding the redirectioning to and from the ErrorController, and for not  having to implement a custom /error method there, you can simply:</p>
<p>2.1: add these two props at the application.properties:</p>
<pre><code>spring.mvc.throw-exception-if-no-handler-found=true
spring.web.resources.add-mappings=false
</code></pre>
<p>2.2: at your @AdviceController @ExceptionHandler method you then will be able to catch the NoHandlerFoundException event, as when catching any other exception event there, then mounting your ResponseEntity and payload data. And, most importantly, as there won't be the redirectioning to and from the ErrorController (/error), you'll be able to get the original path the user tried to access from the HttpServletRequest.</p>

            return HttpResponseRedirect(request.path)

<p>This doesn't interfere with the actual model save process, and simply prevents the 500 error redirect. (Note this will disable the debug stacktrace handling. You could add some conditional handling to add that back in).</p>

66829643,Cloud Firestore inequality operator exception flutter,66829671,"<p>This is explained in the <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/order-limit-data#limitations"" rel=""noreferrer"">ordering limitations documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you include a filter with a range comparison (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=), your first ordering must be on the same field</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I suspect you should have:</p>
<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>        .where('category_id', isEqualTo: id)
        .where('stock', isGreaterThanOrEqualTo: 1)
        .orderBy('stock')
        .orderBy('order')
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously that means it's no longer <em>primarily</em> ordered by <code>order</code>. You'd need to do local sorting if that's a problem - in which case you may find you don't want to order server-side at all.</p>
<p>Although &quot;not equal to&quot; filters aren't mentioned in the documentation, it sounds like they also count as range comparisons in terms of prohibiting filtering.</p>
<p>So basically, I would suggest you <em>either</em> need to filter locally on <code>stock</code>, or you need to order locally on <code>order</code> - you can't do both in the same Firestore query at the moment. Note that this server-side limitation is something that <em>could</em> change in the future (either for all range comparisons, or possibly just to allow &quot;not equal to&quot;) so it may be worth retesting periodically.</p>
"
66829643,Cloud Firestore inequality operator exception flutter,72148576,"<p>You may need to do these two things. (it worked for me as shown in the example down below).</p>
<p>1 - Add an index for <em>stock</em> as Ascending in the console. This index should be in ascending.</p>
<p>2 - You must query based on that index.. So, as opposed to doing</p>
<pre><code>...
.where('stock', isGreaterThanOrEqualTo: 1)
...

<p>You should be doing</p>
<pre><code>...
.orderBy('stock', descending: false)

<p><em><strong>This applies to all other composite indexes that have equality checks.</strong></em> So you may need to do that for <em>category_id</em></p>

You can however use <code>i.ID.Equals(someId)</code> in place of the <code>==</code> operator.</p>
<p>Casting <code>IQueryable</code> to <code>IEnumerable</code> works but <strong>should not be used!</strong> The reason is: <code>IQueryable</code> has funky implementation of <code>IEnumerable</code>. Whatever linq method you'll use on a <code>IQueryable</code> through the <code>IEnumerable</code> interface will cause the query to be executed first, have all the results fetched to the memory from the DB and eventually running the method localy on the data (normally those methods would be translated to SQL and executed in the DB). Imagine trying to get a single row from a table containing billion rows, fetching all of them only to pick one (and it gets much worse with careless casting of <code>IQueryable</code> to <code>IEnumerable</code> and lazy loading related data).</p>

<pre><code>class PermissionDenied(Exception):

6310241,Pros and Cons of implementing a generic custom exception,6310278,"<p>Personally, i don't think it's a good idea.</p>

<p>You should always throw as specific exceptions as possible. The same goes for catching.</p>

<p>It's easy to decide if we want to catch a <code>WebServiceException</code> or <code>AuthenticationException</code>, but with your Enum-example, we have to parse a string to decide if we want to catch it or not. What happens if this message changes?</p>

<p>I don't think it has any benefits at all. For each error type, you have to create a new Enum member. Why not create a new class instead?</p>
"
6310241,Pros and Cons of implementing a generic custom exception,6310345,"<p>The major advantage of custom exceptions is the language support for differentiation between different exception types.  For example </p>

<pre><code>try 
{
    SomeFunc()
}
catch( CustomException EX)
{
    //This is my error that I know how to fix
    FixThis()
    DoSomeAwesomeStuff()
}
catch( Exception exa)
{
    //Somthing else is wrong 
    WeepLikeBaby();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I use the message Property </p>

<pre><code>try 
{
    SomeFunc()
}
catch( Exception exa)
{
    if(exa.Message == ""ErrType 1"")
    {
        DoStuff;
    }
    if(exa.Message == ""ErrType 2"")
    { 
         Die();
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Utilizing The Base enum example can still retain this capability.  However you give yourself one place to define your messages, but that is solved in a variety of different ways by applications.  The enum example would make creating localized messages pretty simple as It will give you A way to define your message strings independently.  </p>

<p>Another Advantage is that you can add Cusotm data that makes sense in you application.  Say for example you have a customer information system, and the customer ID is almost always going to be important.  If you utilize the message property only, every handler will have to know how to parse out that information if needed.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyCustomeEx : Exception
{
    int CustID { get; set; }
}

public void Fail()
{ 
    //Awww Customer error
    throw new MyCustomeEx () {CustID = 123}
}

"
6310241,Pros and Cons of implementing a generic custom exception,6310339,"<p>Option 1 I would not recommend. You should not be throwing <code>System.Exception</code> at all. You should always throw the most specific exception available for your situation in order to have reasonably structured exception handling in your code.</p>

<p>The major drawback I see in your proposed method (<code>Errors enum</code>) is that there is no way you can decide if you want to handle or not the exception without catching it first. With custom exceptions you can make that decision beforehand.  </p>

17670744,Getting &quot;Invalid Column Name &quot; Sql Exception in the following code,17670806,"<p>The message says that there is no column named 'Sagar' in the table. Is there such a column? Things would be easier if you showed us the table schema instead of having us guess from the error message.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>It is not possible to parameterize column names using <code>SqlParameter</code> in C#. This has been discussed here multiple times.</strong></p>

<p>What's happening with the query the way <code>Vidhya Sagar Reddy</code> is doing it, is the following. He assumes that the following query</p>

<pre><code>Select * from Employee Where @field = 'Sagar'
</code></pre>

<p>is replaced by this query when setting <code>""Name""</code> as the value for the <code>@field</code> parameter:</p>

<pre><code>Select * from Employee Where Name = 'Sagar'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This, however, is wrong!</strong> What's happening is that the <code>@field</code> parameter is replaced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Select * from Employee Where 'Name' = 'Sagar'
</code></pre>

<p>This returns no results, as the <code>WHERE</code> clause is always <code>false</code>. Of course, if you use the field name <code>Sagar</code>, this akways returns <code>true</code>, as the statement then reads:</p>

<pre><code>Select * from Employee Where 'Sagar' = 'Sagar'
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Here's an easy test to prove what I've said above. Use the following statement to set the <code>@field</code> parameter (supposed, there's no column named <code>eirghoerihgoh</code> in the table):</p>

<pre><code>com.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@field"", ""eirghoerihgoh"");
</code></pre>

<p>If the query executes correctly (maybe not returning any results), the above is correct. If it was not correct, an exception should be thrown about the <code>eirghoerihgoh</code> column not being present.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you <code>Vidhya Sagar Reddy</code> for proving my point. By using this line</p>

<pre><code>com.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@field"", ""eirghoerihgoh"");

<p>there had to be an exception saying that there was no column named <code>eirghoerihgoh</code>. As you didn't get that exception, there's only one possible explanation: The statement was changed to</p>

<p>This is my vector table.  The arm documents tell you the exact makeup of this
first part of the vector table.  Beyond this it is some number of dozens of interrupts.  The interrupts are very specific to the chip which is from companies like ST or NXP or others, and has nothing to do with ARM so they are not involved other than providing dozens of interrupt signals.</p>
<p>For the assembly language you need to use .thumb_func for gnu assembler, or
.type ... function.  Can look at the assembly language output from gcc to see that they tend to put both, you can pick one or the other  (otherwise your vector table will not work or you will fall into some bad hacks that folks use rather than do it right)</p>
<pre><code>.thumb_func
reset:
...
.thumb_func
hang:
</code></pre>
<p>With this architecture you do not need to wrap an interrupt handler with code to save state.  If the compiler conforms to a matching abi, then you can simply put the C function name of the handler in the table directly, as shown above.</p>
<p>The bootstrap and linker script tend to be married, well almost have to be, and then for whatever reason folks tend to then overload them with library stuff making the linker script, the bootstrap, and the libraries being married and inseparable.</p>
<p>Typically the handler at least the one used by reset, is in flash.  So cannot be changed/registered runtime.</p>
<p>Some cores, but not all, have a VTOR register where you can, with rules, change the location of the vector table used by the logic.  And that means you can, yes, use another flash address if you are having field upgradable applications, but you can also point it at sram in most implementations, allowing for runtime changes.</p>
<p>Or you could do something like this:</p>
<p>stacktop: .word 0x20001000
.word reset             //  1 reset
.word hang              //  2 NMI
.word hang              //  3 hard fault
.word hang              //  4 Reserved
.word hang              //  5 Reserved
.word hang              //  6 Reserved
.word hang              //  7 Reserved
.word hang              //  8 Reserved
.word hang              //  9 Reserved
.word hang              // 10 Reserved
.word hang              // 11 SVCall
.word hang              // 12 Reserved
.word hang              // 13 Reserved
.word hang              // 14 PendSV
.word 0x20000001        // 15 SysTick</p>
<p>And then runtime you can fill CODE not a vector, at 0x20000000.</p>
<p>I point these options out because there is no one hard and fast rule for how a companies sandbox solution(s) will be designed.   Even if VTOR can be changed does not automatically mean that the vendor is going to use that solution.</p>
<p>Not using libraries means to me, doing your own linker script and bootstrap as well as application.  And as a result you are in control and can easily see how to solve this.  If you are doing a hybrid and using someone elses bootstrap, then you need to understand their solution and adapt to it or modify it.</p>

49700265,Remove new lines from Message and Exception,49739064,"<p>After digging into this for a while, I was able to come up with an answer. Andy West's answer pointed me in the right direction.</p>

<p>There are two separate issues here: CRLFs in the message and CRLFs in the exception.</p>

<p>I was able to solve the message problem by changing ""{Message}"" to ""{Message:j}"" in the outputTemplate.</p>

<p>Changing the exception was a little trickier. I had to add an enricher:</p>

<pre><code>class ExceptionEnricher : ILogEventEnricher
{
    public void Enrich(LogEvent logEvent, ILogEventPropertyFactory propertyFactory)
    {
        if (logEvent.Exception == null)
            return;

        var logEventProperty = propertyFactory.CreateProperty(""EscapedException"", logEvent.Exception.ToString().Replace(""\r\n"", ""\\r\\n""));
        logEvent.AddPropertyIfAbsent(logEventProperty);
    }        
}
</code></pre>

<p>This adds and new property called EscapedException. This has to be added to the configuration with .Enrich.With().</p>

<p>Then I replaced ""{Exception}"" with ""{EscapedException}"" in the outputTemplate.</p>

<h2>How do I manually throw/raise an exception in Python?</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Use the most specific Exception constructor that semantically fits your issue</a>.</p>
<p>Be specific in your message, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>raise ValueError('A very specific bad thing happened.')
</code></pre>
<h2>Don't raise generic exceptions</h2>
<p>Avoid raising a generic <code>Exception</code>. To catch it, you'll have to catch all other more specific exceptions that subclass it.</p>
<h3>Problem 1: Hiding bugs</h3>
<pre><code>raise Exception('I know Python!') # Don't! If you catch, likely to hide bugs.
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>def demo_bad_catch():
    try:
        raise ValueError('Represents a hidden bug, do not catch this')
        raise Exception('This is the exception you expect to handle')
    except Exception as error:
        print('Caught this error: ' + repr(error))

&gt;&gt;&gt; demo_bad_catch()
Caught this error: ValueError('Represents a hidden bug, do not catch this',)
</code></pre>
<h3>Problem 2: Won't catch</h3>
<p>And more specific catches won't catch the general exception:</p>
<pre><code>def demo_no_catch():
    try:
        raise Exception('general exceptions not caught by specific handling')
    except ValueError as e:
        print('we will not catch exception: Exception')
 

&gt;&gt;&gt; demo_no_catch()

  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 3, in demo_no_catch
Exception: general exceptions not caught by specific handling
</code></pre>
<h2>Best Practices: <code>raise</code> statement</h2>
<p><a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Instead, use the most specific Exception constructor that semantically fits your issue</a>.</p>
<pre><code>raise ValueError('A very specific bad thing happened')
</code></pre>
<p>which also handily allows an arbitrary number of arguments to be passed to the constructor:</p>
<pre><code>raise ValueError('A very specific bad thing happened', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz') 
</code></pre>
<p>These arguments are accessed by the <code>args</code> attribute on the <code>Exception</code> object. For example:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    some_code_that_may_raise_our_value_error()
except ValueError as err:
    print(err.args)
</code></pre>
<p>prints</p>
<pre><code>('message', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz')    
</code></pre>
<p>In Python 2.5, an actual <code>message</code> attribute was added to <code>BaseException</code> in favor of encouraging users to subclass Exceptions and stop using <code>args</code>, but <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0352/#retracted-ideas"" rel=""noreferrer"">the introduction of <code>message</code> and the original deprecation of args has been retracted</a>.</p>
<h2>Best Practices: <code>except</code> clause</h2>
<p>When inside an except clause, you might want to, for example, log that a specific type of error happened, and then re-raise. The best way to do this while preserving the stack trace is to use a bare raise statement. For example:</p>
<pre><code>logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

try:
    do_something_in_app_that_breaks_easily()
except AppError as error:
    logger.error(error)
    raise                 # just this!
    # raise AppError      # Don't do this, you'll lose the stack trace!
</code></pre>
<h3>Don't modify your errors... but if you insist.</h3>
<p>You can preserve the stacktrace (and error value) with <code>sys.exc_info()</code>, but <strong>this is way more error prone</strong> and <strong>has compatibility problems between Python 2 and 3</strong>, prefer to use a bare <code>raise</code> to re-raise.</p>
<p>To explain - the <code>sys.exc_info()</code> returns the type, value, and traceback.</p>
<pre><code>type, value, traceback = sys.exc_info()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the syntax in Python 2 - note this is not compatible with Python 3:</p>
<pre><code>raise AppError, error, sys.exc_info()[2] # avoid this.
# Equivalently, as error *is* the second object:
raise sys.exc_info()[0], sys.exc_info()[1], sys.exc_info()[2]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to, you can modify what happens with your new raise - e.g. setting new <code>args</code> for the instance:</p>
<pre><code>def error():
    raise ValueError('oops!')

def catch_error_modify_message():
    try:
        error()
    except ValueError:
        error_type, error_instance, traceback = sys.exc_info()
        error_instance.args = (error_instance.args[0] + ' &lt;modification&gt;',)
        raise error_type, error_instance, traceback
</code></pre>
<p>And we have preserved the whole traceback while modifying the args. Note that this is <strong>not a best practice</strong> and it is <strong>invalid syntax</strong> in Python 3 (making keeping compatibility much harder to work around).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; catch_error_modify_message()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 3, in catch_error_modify_message
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in error
ValueError: oops! &lt;modification&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python 3</a>:</p>
<pre><code>raise error.with_traceback(sys.exc_info()[2])
</code></pre>
<p>Again: avoid manually manipulating tracebacks. It's <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement"" rel=""noreferrer"">less efficient</a> and more error prone. And if you're using threading and <code>sys.exc_info</code> you may even get the wrong traceback (especially if you're using exception handling for control flow - which I'd personally tend to avoid.)</p>
<h3>Python 3, Exception chaining</h3>
<p>In Python 3, you can chain Exceptions, which preserve tracebacks:</p>
<pre><code>raise RuntimeError('specific message') from error
</code></pre>
<p>Be aware:</p>
<ul>
<li>this <em>does</em> allow changing the error type raised, and</li>
<li>this is <em>not</em> compatible with Python 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deprecated Methods:</h3>
<p>These can easily hide and even get into production code. You want to raise an exception, and doing them will raise an exception, <strong>but not the one intended!</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3109/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Valid in Python 2, but not in Python 3</a> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>raise ValueError, 'message' # Don't do this, it's deprecated!
</code></pre>
<p>Only <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.5.html#pep-352-exceptions-as-new-style-classes"" rel=""noreferrer"">valid in much older versions of Python</a> (2.4 and lower), you may still see people raising strings:</p>
<pre><code>raise 'message' # really really wrong. don't do this.
</code></pre>
<p>In all modern versions, this will actually raise a <code>TypeError</code>, because you're not raising a <code>BaseException</code> type. If you're not checking for the right exception and don't have a reviewer that's aware of the issue, it could get into production.</p>
<h2>Example Usage</h2>
<p>I raise Exceptions to warn consumers of my API if they're using it incorrectly:</p>
<pre><code>def api_func(foo):
    '''foo should be either 'baz' or 'bar'. returns something very useful.'''
    if foo not in _ALLOWED_ARGS:
        raise ValueError('{foo} wrong, use &quot;baz&quot; or &quot;bar&quot;'.format(foo=repr(foo)))
</code></pre>
<h2>Create your own error types when apropos</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;I want to make an error on purpose, so that it would go into the except&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can create your own error types, if you want to indicate something specific is wrong with your application, just subclass the appropriate point in the exception hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code>class MyAppLookupError(LookupError):
    '''raise this when there's a lookup error for my app'''
</code></pre>
<p>and usage:</p>
<pre><code>if important_key not in resource_dict and not ok_to_be_missing:
    raise MyAppLookupError('resource is missing, and that is not ok.')
</code></pre>

"
2052390,Manually raising (throwing) an exception in Python,40493467,"<p>In Python 3 there are four different syntaxes for raising exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>raise exception</li>
<li>raise exception (args)</li>
<li>raise</li>
<li>raise exception (args) from original_exception</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Raise exception vs. 2. raise exception (args)</h3>
<p>If you use <code>raise exception (args)</code> to raise an exception then the <code>args</code> will be printed when you print the exception object - as shown in the example below.</p>
<pre><code># Raise exception (args)
try:
    raise ValueError(&quot;I have raised an Exception&quot;)
except ValueError as exp:
    print(&quot;Error&quot;, exp)     # Output -&gt; Error I have raised an Exception


# Raise exception
try:
    raise ValueError
except ValueError as exp:
    print(&quot;Error&quot;, exp)     # Output -&gt; Error
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Statement <em>raise</em></h3>
<p>The <code>raise</code> statement without any arguments re-raises the last exception.</p>
<p>This is useful if you need to perform some actions after catching the exception and then want to re-raise it. But if there wasn't any exception before, the <code>raise</code> statement raises  a <code>TypeError</code> Exception.</p>
<pre><code>def somefunction():
    print(&quot;some cleaning&quot;)

a = 10
b = 0
result = None

try:
    result = a / b
    print(result)

except Exception:            # Output -&gt;
    somefunction()           # Some cleaning
    raise                    # Traceback (most recent call last):
                             # File &quot;python&quot;, line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
                             # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
</code></pre>
<h3>4. Raise exception (args) from original_exception</h3>
<p>This statement is used to create exception chaining in which an exception that is raised in response to another exception can contain the details of the original exception - as shown in the example below.</p>
<pre><code>class MyCustomException(Exception):
    pass

a = 10
b = 0
reuslt = None
try:
    try:
        result = a / b

    except ZeroDivisionError as exp:

<p>If the clean-up is vital even when the program crashes, then <code>finally</code> can never be enough, as it can't deal with e.g. a power plug being pulled out, which in the sort of cases where clean up is vital even in a crash, is a case that needs to be considered.</p>

<p>In any case where the exception is caught further up and the program continues, the <code>finally</code> will run.</p>

<p>With catchable exceptions that aren't caught, then <code>finally</code> blocks will generally run, but there are still some exceptions.

<p>8.9.5 The throw statement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we see the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an exception is thrown, control is transferred
to the first catch clause in an enclosing try statement that can
handle the exception. The process that takes place from the point of
the exception being thrown to the point of transferring control to a
suitable exception handler is known as exception propagation.
Propagation of an exception consists of repeatedly evaluating the
following steps until a catch clause that matches the exception is
found. In this description, the throw point is initially the location
at which the exception is thrown.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the current function member,
each try statement that encloses the throw point is examined. For each
statement S, starting with the innermost try statement and ending with
the outermost try statement, the following steps are evaluated:
<ul>
<li>If
the try block of S encloses the throw point and if S has one or more
catch clauses, the catch clauses are examined in order of appearance
to locate a suitable handler for the exception. The first catch clause
that specifies the exception type or a base type of the exception type
is considered a match. A general catch clause (§8.10) is considered a
match for any exception type. If a matching catch clause is located,
the exception propagation is completed by transferring control to the
block of that catch clause.</li>
<li><strong>Otherwise, if the try block or a catch
block of S encloses the throw point and if S has a finally block,
control is transferred to the finally block. If the finally block
throws another exception, processing of the current exception is
terminated. Otherwise, when control reaches the end point of the
finally block, processing of the current exception is continued</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If
an exception handler was not located in the current function
invocation, the function invocation is terminated, and one of the
following occurs:
<ul>
<li>If the current function is non-async, the steps
above are repeated for the caller of the function with a throw point
corresponding to the statement from which the function member was
invoked.</li>
<li>If the current function is async and task-returning, the
exception is recorded in the return task, which is put into a faulted
or cancelled state as described in §10.14.1.</li>
<li>If the current function
is async and void-returning, the synchronization context of the
current thread is notified as described in §10.14.2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If the
exception processing terminates all function member invocations in the
current thread, indicating that the thread has no handler for the
exception, then the thread is itself terminated. The impact of such
termination is implementation-defined</strong>.</li>

70044393,Fatal Android 12: Exception: startForegroundService() not allowed due to mAllowStartForeground false,75338150,"<p>Up to <code>Android 12</code> it is enough to use the <a href=""https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/features#fg-service-types"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">android:foregroundServiceType=&quot;yourType&quot;</a> service attribute in the <code>AndroidManifest</code> to start your service from background (I assume that you need to skip this step if you don't find a suitable service type. Unfortunately, I haven't found information about this in docs). In Android 12 and above - If your task allows you to use <code>WorkManager</code>, then you should replace your service with <code>Worker</code>, e.g. to download/upload a file or for periodic synchronization. If your task is more extensive and requires the service to be constantly running in the background, e.g, playing audio, then here you still need to use the foreground service, but run it using the <code>AlarmManager</code>. If your service should be started immediately then you need to use exact alarm to start your service. For this purpose you must be sure user granted <code>SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</code> permission. It is granted by the system automatically, but can be revoked by the user or by the system anytime.</p>

10404407,Should Service layer throw an exception?,10404497,"<p>Depends on what you mean by service and exception, but in the context you've got, I'll assume a java exception from an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>The answer is no. Services should expose errors in a general way. In the case of Restful service, errors should be propagated as HTTP status with error codes. The service shouldn't leak implementation details to consumers. It's a natural boundary.</p>
<p>The Consumer should handle those error situations and decide the most appropriate what to communicate. It may well choose to generate an exception.  But these exceptions are disjoint from the original issue/exception that caused the service to return an error code.</p>
<p>Going further I would say @yahir is right in what he says also. HTTP service would expose HTTP errors, and it may well just be using another service underneath that returns another kind of error, but its job will be to handle or map them appropriately.</p>

<pre><code>a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
a = a + ['d']

print a
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
</code></pre>

49456838,How to throw an exception in Azure Logic Apps?,62378523,"<h2>Quick Answer (TL;DR)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Problem: MSFT Azure logic app throwing exceptions</li>
<li>Workaround: Use logic app Scope element to simulate throwing exceptions
<ul>
<li>Create a scope element to use as your &quot;try-catch&quot; block</li>
<li>Force the scope element to fail with an invalid command to simulate an exception</li>
<li>Allow the scope element to fail naturally and that will count as an exception too</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detailed Answer</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>MSFT Azure logic app workflows</li>
<li>live version as of 2020-06-14</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Developer wishes to throw an exception or use try-catch semantics in a logic app</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>As of this writing, the live version of the product does not support this feature. There is a workaround.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workaround</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use logic app scope element</li>
<li>add a conditional statement inside the scope element</li>
<li>If the conditional statement meets the failure condition, force an exception with a deliberately invalid command
<ul>
<li>for example create a variable assignment with the value <code>int('__ERROR__')</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the conditional statement does not meet the failure condition, do nothing</li>
<li>The rest of the logic app consists of two paths
<ul>
<li>The first path runs on the success of the scope element</li>
<li>The second path runs on the failure of the scope element (failed, skipped, timed out)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a scope element as a &quot;try-catch&quot; block</li>

<p>The closest you can get right now would be to do something like use another LogicApp instead of a scope from which you can return a specific status code.</p>
