<ol>
<li>the easiest one delete your database if data is not important and then run migrate command</li>
<li>delete your that app migration files then if you can access the data base which you can by xamp or db browser and then run migration again while deleting dont delete the ini.py file in migartion.  then run the command python manage.py makemigrations your_app_name then migrate by command python manage.py migrate your_app_name this would resolve your issue</li>

64046112,How to fix this error : Ask your hosting provider to use PHP 7.2.5 or higher for both HTTP and CLI?,66485403,"<p>So there may be many, many reasons for this issue, hopefully one answer will resolve it for you. In my case, I had to do 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the Global PHP version as stated by Zehsan;</li>
<li>In the address bar, I replaced &quot;requirements&quot; with &quot;language&quot;;</li>
</ol>
<p>So for part 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>my.akaunting.com/install/<strong>requirements</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>would become:</p>
<ul>
<li>my.akaunting.com/install/<strong>language</strong></li>

"
64046112,How to fix this error : Ask your hosting provider to use PHP 7.2.5 or higher for both HTTP and CLI?,71899926,"<p>The reason why for this error is because Akaunting is using command line (CLi) <code>php</code> to get your installed php version instead of universal accepted method of getting php version through built in <code>phpinfo()</code>.</p>
<p>Because it's using CLi <code>php</code> it might not work properly with xampp or any other php hosting server that did not configure the right path to <code>php</code> binary in the environment variables</p>
<p>To fix this in windows, locate <code>php.exe</code> most probably in [pathTo]\xampp\php\php.exe and add them into your windows environment variables .
Launch cmd and execute this</p>
<pre><code>setx PATH &quot;%PATH%;drive:\path\to\your\php.exe&quot;

<p>To fix this in Linux, locate <code>php</code> binary path, most probably at in [path]/bin folder`.
Launch Shell/bash</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:/place/with/path/to/php

61355620,JFrog Artifactory error: Pushing Docker images with manifest v2 schema 1 to this repository is blocked,61356179,"<p>The root of this problem can probably be classified as user error.  Specifically the user I'm using somehow had permissions removed from the release repository.  Once that was restored everything works as expected.</p>

<p>I say ""probably"" because the error message has nothing to do with the actual problem, and cost me 2-3 hours worth of wild goose chasing.</p>

<p>The fix was to change a setting on the remote repository.</p>

71164059,SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed in ruby and Ubuntu 14.04,71388442,"<p><strong>-Solutions</strong>
Update CA certificates
The correct solution depends on which code connects to an HTTPS URL. The first thing you can try is to update the root certificates on your machine.</p>
<p>If you’re using Linux, you can use your package manager to update the CA certificates.</p>
<pre><code>apt-get update ca-certificates
yum update ca-certificates
</code></pre>
<p>On RVM on OSX, you can run</p>
<pre><code>rvm osx-ssl-certs update all
</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t use RVM, you can extract the certificates from Apple’s Keychain yourself.</p>
<pre><code>cert_file='$( openssl version -d | awk -F''' '{print $2}' )/cert.pem'
mkdir -p '${cert_file%/*}'
security find-certificate -a -p /Library/Keychains/System.keychain &gt; '$cert_file'
security find-certificate -a -p 
/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain &gt;&gt; '$cert_file'

"
71164059,SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed in ruby and Ubuntu 14.04,71389616,"<p>One thing you might check is that your certs directory   (often  /etc/ssl/certs )  contains both your certificate AND a symbolic link to that cert (based on a hash of the certificate).</p>
<p>openssl uses the symbolic link to look up the certificate and other certificates up the chain.  If you do a &quot;ls -l &quot; in your certs directory, you ought to see many lines something like this:</p>
<pre><code>lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     18 Dec  2  2017 f39fc864.0 -&gt; SecureTrust_CA.pem
</code></pre>
<p>The file name f39fc864 is a hash of the certificate, and the .0 suffix is required.  If your certificate does not have such a link, and even if it does, you can enter:</p>
<pre><code>openssl x509 -noout -hash -in mycertfile.pem
</code></pre>
<p>and it will generate an 8-digit hash, like 23cd45d6.</p>
<p>After you generate the hash, you would just create the link using a command that looks like this (where you would substitute your file and your hash, obviously):</p>
<pre><code>ln -s mycertfile.pem  23cd45d6.0
</code></pre>
<p>In fact openssl has a command  &quot;c_rehash&quot; that will do this for you.
The man page for openssl c_rehash will guide you.   But on many systems it will be as simple as</p>
<pre><code>openssl c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs
</code></pre>

<p>I began experiencing these messages in iOS 11 (and the corresponding Xcode versions) when testing my program locally.</p>

<p>I noticed that I only saw these errors when testing against my local Django server. When pointing the app a normal, appropriately configured webserver, I would not see them.</p>

<p>Some related reading suggests (but not definitively) that this message might have to do with contacting servers which do not have SSL configured (properly, or at all). This would correlate with my experiences.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I see these errors constantly when testing on my local server, however, I have yet to notice a single instance where this has resulted in adverse behavior, such as a failed request, and in fact, my response handlers don't even think that a proper HTTP error has taken place.</p>

<p>My assessment of all this information is that this is typical Xcode noise resulting from the underlying network APIs fighting with poorly configured webserver stacks.</p>

<p>To solve this, I changed the version of <code>@vue/cli-plugin-babel</code> to <code>&quot;~5.0.0&quot;</code>.</p>
<p><code>package.json</code></p>

59687926,Staged Internal file csv.gz giving error that file does not match size of corresponding table?,59688207,"<p>Your error doesn't say that you have too many characters but that your file has 8 columns and your table has 9 columns, so it doesn't know how to align the columns from the file to the columns in the table.</p>

<p>You can list out the columns specifically using a subquery in your <code>COPY INTO</code> statement.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Notes:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Columns from the file are positional based, so $1 is the first column in the file, $2 is the second, etc....  </li>
<li>You can put the columns from the file in any order that you need to match your table.  </li>
<li>You'll need to find the column that doesn't have data coming in from the file and either fill it with <code>null</code> or some default value.  In my example, I assume it is the last column and in it I will put the current timestamp.</li>
<li>It helps to list out the columns of the table behind the table name, but this is not required.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>COPY INTO ARRAYLOC (COLUMN1,COLUMN2,COLUMN3,COLUMN4,COLUMN5,COLUMN6,COLUMN7,COLUMN8,COLUMN9)

    SELECT $1
      ,$2

      ,$7 
      ,$8
      ,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
   FROM @staged/array-of-things-locations-1.csv.gz
);
</code></pre>

<p>I will advise against changing the <code>ERROR_ON_COLUMN_COUNT_MISMATCH</code> parameter, doing so could result in data ending up in the wrong column of the table.  I would also advise against changing the <code>ON_ERROR</code> parameter as I believe it is best to be alerted of such errors rather than suppressing them.</p>
"
59687926,Staged Internal file csv.gz giving error that file does not match size of corresponding table?,59688208,"<p>Yes, setting that option should help. From <a href=""https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ERROR_ON_COLUMN_COUNT_MISMATCH = TRUE | FALSE
  Use: Data loading only</p>
  
  <p>Definition: Boolean that specifies whether to generate a parsing error
  if the number of delimited columns (i.e. fields) in an input file does
  not match the number of columns in the corresponding table.</p>
  
  <p>If set to FALSE, an error is not generated and the load continues. If
  the file is successfully loaded:</p>
  
  <p>If the input file contains records with more fields than columns in
  the table, the matching fields are loaded in order of occurrence in
  the file and the remaining fields are not loaded.</p>
  
  <p>If the input file contains records with fewer fields than columns in
  the table, the non-matching columns in the table are loaded with NULL
  values.</p>
  
  <p>This option assumes all the records within the input file are the same
  length (i.e. a file containing records of varying length return an
  error regardless of the value specified for this parameter).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So assuming you are okay with getting <code>NULL</code> values for the missing column in your input data, you can use <code>ERROR_ON_COLUMN_COUNT_MISMATCH=FALSE</code> to load the file successfully.</p>

55381133,An error has occured in JaCoCo report generation,58877507,"<p>I've been having a similar problem. I'm writing even though the question is months old as it was very time consuming to figure out and no amount of googling provided me with a straight answer but only to clues I had to piece together myself.</p>

<hr>

<p>In my case the error happened roughly once every three builds. The error also wasn't always the same as stated in this question: the byte number was changing and sometimes I just got an EOFException instead.</p>

<p>There is a degree of guesswork in my assessment. Here follows the bottomline of my investigation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The error seems to happen as a result of JaCoCo being unable to (fully) write the <code>JaCoCo.exec</code> file, probably due to the corresponding VM being terminated before the write operation completes (or starts). To note that JaCoCo writes said file only when the VM is exiting.</li>
<li>If you do multithreading, it could happen because of a thread still running in background causing a timeout in <code>maven-surefire-plugin</code> or <code>maven-failsafe-plugin</code> to trigger. Make sure all your threads run to completion.</li>
<li>If the issue is caused by unusual slowness of your machine, you should be able to overcome the problem by setting the <code>forkedProcessExitTimeoutInSeconds</code> option to a value greater than the default <code>30</code> seconds (or otherwise greater than what you have currently set) in your <code>maven-surefire-plugin</code> or <code>maven-failsafe-plugin</code>. This was my case, as I was forced to run the build against a very slow and memory-constrained VM.</li>
<li>Make sure the <code>forkCount</code> property is greater than <code>0</code> in your <code>maven-surefire-plugin</code> or <code>maven-failsafe-plugin</code> and that <code>forkMode</code> is <em>NOT</em> set to <code>never</code> as JaCoCo needs to work on a forked process in order for the file to be written and therefore picked up afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.22.2&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;forkedProcessExitTimeoutInSeconds&gt;60&lt;/forkedProcessExitTimeoutInSeconds&gt;
        &lt;forkCount&gt;1&lt;/forkCount&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;

35703072,How do I send 401 error codes instead of 403 with a custom permission class?,35706392,"<p>Basically, I didn't really understand the difference between permissions and authentications, so that led to confusion. The permissions class has no authenticate_header method, but the authentication class does. Here is what I did to solve the problem:</p>

<pre><code>from rest_framework import exceptions
from rest_framework import authentication
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

def authenticateUser(username, password):
    try:
        user = User.objects.get(username=username)
        return user.check_password(password)
    except:
        return False

class CustomAuthentication(authentication.BaseAuthentication):
    def authenticate(self, request):
        username = request.POST.get('username', None)
        password = request.POST.get('password', None)
        authenticated = authenticateUser(username, password)
        if(not authenticated and username is not None and password is not None):
            #authentication attempted and failed
            raise exceptions.AuthenticationFailed('Username/password pair not found')
        elif(not authenticated):
            #authentication not attempted (try other authentications)
            return None
        else:
            #authentication attempted and suceeded
            return (User.objects.get(username=username), None)


    def authenticate_header(self, request):
        return '{""username"" : &lt;username&gt;, ""password"" : &lt;password&gt;}'
</code></pre>

<p>In my view:</p>

<pre><code>permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)
authentication_classes = (CustomAuthentication, SessionAuthentication)
</code></pre>

<p>This confusion of permissions and authentication also explains why my attempt to combine multiple permission classes failed (you may note in my original code that I inherited from a permission class and called its has_permission method in order to get around this). I no longer need a custom permission class because I can just use two authentication classes.</p>
"
35703072,How do I send 401 error codes instead of 403 with a custom permission class?,71114211,"<p>Note that it is mandatory to implement:</p>

33049688,"What causes the error &quot;_pickle.UnpicklingError: invalid load key, &#39; &#39;.&quot;?",33054024,"<p>pickling is recursive, not sequential.  Thus, to pickle a list, <code>pickle</code> will start to pickle the containing list, then pickle the first element… diving into the first element and pickling dependencies and sub-elements until the first element is serialized. Then moves on to the next element of the list, and so on, until it finally finishes the list and finishes serializing the enclosing list.  In short, it's hard to treat a recursive pickle as sequential, except for some special cases.  It's better to use a smarter pattern on your <code>dump</code>, if you want to <code>load</code> in a special way.</p>

<p>The most common pickle, it to pickle everything with a single <code>dump</code> to a file -- but then you have to <code>load</code> everything at once with a single <code>load</code>.  However, if you open a file handle and do multiple <code>dump</code> calls (e.g. one for each element of the list, or a tuple of selected elements), then your <code>load</code> will mirror that… you open the file handle and do multiple <code>load</code> calls until you have all the list elements and can reconstruct the list.  It's still not easy to selectively <code>load</code> only certain list elements, however.  To do that, you'd probably have to store your list elements as a <code>dict</code> (with the index of the element or chunk as the key) using a package like <code>klepto</code>, which can break up a pickled <code>dict</code> into several files transparently, and enables easy loading of specific elements.</p>

Whenever you grab types from there, ideally, you'd be grabbing the types package with matching major and minor version numbers for the version of the package that it provides typings for (see <a href=""https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#how-do-definitely-typed-package-versions-relate-to-versions-of-the-corresponding-library"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How do Definitely Typed package versions relate to versions of the corresponding library?</a>).

<p>The concept of peer dependencies can cause challenges when installing packages. Consider the following scenario:</p>
<p>Package A requires Package B, and both have a common peer dependency, Package C. However, Package A requires Package C in version 1.x, while Package B requires Package C in version 2.x.</p>
<p>When you try to install Package A and Package B together in your project, npm might encounter a conflict due to the different peer dependency versions required by each package. This can lead to installation failures, and it becomes challenging to resolve the conflicts manually.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;npm config set legacy-peer-deps true&quot;</strong></p>
<p>To alleviate the complications caused by conflicting peer dependencies, npm introduced the &quot;legacy-peer-deps&quot; configuration flag. When set to true, this flag instructs npm to revert to the older behavior of installing packages with peer dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>The &quot;legacy-peer-deps&quot; flag works as follows:</strong></p>
<p>If a package declares a peer dependency, npm will install the specified version without verifying if it satisfies the version range expected by the dependent package.</p>
<p>The flag disables the strict version checking for peer dependencies, making it more permissive during the installation process.</p>
<p><strong>Usage and Example</strong></p>
<p>To set the &quot;legacy-peer-deps&quot; flag to true, open your terminal and run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>npm config set legacy-peer-deps true
npm install
</code></pre>

<p>I.e., you are trying to read a provider as soon as the widget builds. Consider deferring this to a later lifecycle method like <a href=""https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/didChangeDependencies.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>didChangeDependencies</code></a> or utilize a <a href=""https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Builder-class.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Builder</code> widget</a> to make sure the context you are using is a descendant of your provider.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>Builder</code> approach:</p>

<p>That <code>Builder</code> would create a new <code>BuildContext</code> that is a direct child of <code>Scaffold</code>, which should ideally be under your <code>Provider&lt;SubscriptionBloc&gt;</code> if you have structured your widget tree correctly.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href=""https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/didChangeDependencies.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>didChangeDependencies</code> method</a> approach:</p>
<p>That method is called when a dependency of the <code>State</code> object changes.<br />
In your case, if your widget relies on an <a href=""https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>InheritedWidget</code></a> (which is what <a href=""https://pub.dev/packages/provider"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Provider</code></a> uses under the hood), <code>didChangeDependencies</code> is called whenever that inherited widget is updated.</p>
<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>class YourWidget extends StatefulWidget {

<p>The <code>handleSubscription</code> method is moved into <code>didChangeDependencies</code>.<br />
The <code>Provider.of&lt;SubscriptionBloc&gt;(context, listen: false)</code> call fetches the <code>SubscriptionBloc</code> from the nearest ancestor in the widget tree. Since <code>didChangeDependencies</code> is called after <code>initState</code> and every time the widget rebuilds due to a change in an <code>InheritedWidget</code>, it is generally a safe place to access your <code>Provider</code>.</p>

Even if I signIn as Client in both VS2019 and VS2022, VS2019 being reverting back to company's account.. strange!!</p>
<p>so, I had to Uninstall quirky VS2019, and signIn VS2022 for client, the issue resolved...
Please make sure one version of VStudio only exists, if the error keep coming in..! Hope it Helps, HydTechie</p>

11864482,Error handling with Mongoose,12016154,"<p>If you're using Express, errors are typically handled either directly in your route or within an api built on top of mongoose, forwarding the error along to <code>next</code>.</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>app.get('/tickets', function (req, res, next) {
  PlaneTickets.find({}, function (err, tickets) {
    if (err) return next(err);
    // or if no tickets are found maybe
    if (0 === tickets.length) return next(new NotFoundError));
    ...
  })
})
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>NotFoundError</code> could be sniffed in your <a href=""http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">error handler middleware</a> to provide customized messaging.</p>
<p>Some abstraction is possible but you'll still require access to the <code>next</code> method in order to pass the error down the route chain.</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>PlaneTickets.search(term, next, function (tickets) {
    // i don't like this b/c it hides whats going on and changes the (err, result) callback convention of node
})
</code></pre>
<p>As for centrally handling mongoose errors, theres not really one place to handle em all. Errors can be handled at several different levels:</p>
<p><code>connection</code> errors are emitted on the <code>connection</code> your models are using, so</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>mongoose.connect(..);
mongoose.connection.on('error', handler);

// or if using separate connections
var conn = mongoose.createConnection(..);
conn.on('error', handler);
</code></pre>
<p>For typical queries/updates/removes the error is passed to your callback.</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>PlaneTickets.find({..}, function (err, tickets) {
    if (err) ...
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't pass a callback the error is emitted on the Model <em>if you are listening for it:</em></p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>PlaneTickets.on('error', handler); // note the loss of access to the `next` method from the request!
ticket.save(); // no callback passed
</code></pre>
<p>If you do not pass a callback and are not listening to errors at the <code>model</code> level they will be emitted on the models <code>connection</code>.</p>
<p>The key take-away here is that you want access to <code>next</code> somehow to pass the error along.</p>
"
11864482,Error handling with Mongoose,76826713,"<p>Simpler and more up to date solution IMO:</p>
<h2>Connection errors</h2>
<p>Handle connection level errors when you instantiate your db:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const mongooseConnection = mongoose.createConnection(databaseURL)

mongooseConnection.on('error', err =&gt; {
  throw new Error('Mongo database connexion error')
})
</code></pre>
<h2>Query level errors</h2>
<p>Query level errors may appear if you write fields with wrong types or use query options (populate, sort...) incorrectly. We can use a more readable/up to date <code>try catch await</code> over the old <code>promise.callback.catch</code> syntax (<a href=""https://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mongoose doc</a>)</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>try {
  await Band.findOne({ _id: badId }).exec();
} catch (err) {
  throw new Error('Mongo database connexion error')
}
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2>BONUS: advices and good practices</h2>
<p><strong>=&gt; Use an error handler across all your app</strong></p>
<p>Error handling in the 2 example above are not very relevant because you loose all contextual informations (mongo error msg, stack trace, database name, userId...)</p>
<p>You may handle errors in a centralized way so that you can pass contextual informations alongside the error message like so:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>try { ... } catch (err) {
  throw ApplicationError(
    'myMessage',
    {
      // Here we pass additional informations
      // this will help handling the error on the express api side
      httpCode: err instanceof mongoose.Error.ValidationError ? 422 : 500,
      // with this one you can display original error messsage/stack trace
      originalError: err, 
      // other contextual informations may be useful to display
      // but be carreful not to display sensitive informations
      // here (Eg DB connection string)
      databaseName,
      userId,
      userRole,
      methodName,
    }
  )
}

class ApplicationError extends Error {
  constructor(errMsg, additionalInfos) {
    // Here handle error as you want
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href=""https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/error.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">List of all error types thrown by mongoose</a></p>
<p><strong>=&gt; Use a request handler to handle all mongoose queries the same way</strong></p>
<p>A common pattern to avoid duplicating code is to create a function to handle the execution of mongoose promise for you:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>async function afterRequest(mongoosePromise, { sort, page, limit }) {
  try {
    if (sort) promise.sort(sort)

    // PAGINATION
    if (page) promise.skip(localConfig.page * limit || 25).limit(limit || 25)
    else if (limit) promise.limit(limit)

    return await promise.exec()

  } catch (err) { /** handle error like in the above code */ }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So we can now use it like:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const mongoosePromise = Band.find()
afterRequest(mongoosePromise, { page: 1, limit: 10 })

</code></pre>
<p>This pattern has the advantage of:</p>
<ul>
<li>handling all in the same place, so it's the safest place to add custom code for security handling or validation for example</li>
<li>easily exposing some options like pagination... to api or some services that you may not want to deal directly with mongoose requests</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is juste a very simplified example, but to go further, here are some features we could implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>check if the user has the permission to populate</li>
<li>masking certain fields in filter or updated/created fields related to user permissions (a simple user may not been able to write his permissions for example)</li>
<li>force certain filters (companyAdmin may have access only to their company so we want to enforce filter <code>{ companyId: user.companyId }</code></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

But I'll go ahead and summarize things I've found anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For many people it worked simply restarting and rebuilding the project, or doing a full forced npm cache clear and reinstalling node_modules and rebuilding it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People have suggested disabling &quot;ivy&quot; in tsconfig works, however it's also been mentioned that while it works it's not the recommended way of fixing it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This can apparently also happen if you've added components to imports instead of declarations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This can apparently also happen if you've installed some packages as root or if you for some reason don't have permissions on all the packages.  Which was fixed with doing a chown on the directory, however the real solution is to install packages correctly in the first place and configuring the npm config so you don't ever install packages with root permissions.  So essentially if you installed packages with root and try and run the project as non root, it will give this issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people got the error when they added a service to imports instead of providers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People also get this error if they name the package incorrectly i.e. SomeComponent instead of SomeComponentModule.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In your specific case, you've imported the app router before browser module, I have no idea if that could cause an issue but everywhere I've seen the browser module is added before the app, so swap them around if nothing else work and see if that works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about everything I could find.</p>

On the other hand, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">localStorage</a> exists as part of the browser's <em>window</em> global, and thus you can only use it when the component is rendered. Therefore you can only access localStorage in the <code>componentDidMount</code> lifecycle hook. Instead of calling localStorage in the constructor, you can define an empty state, and update the state in <code>componentDidMount</code> when you can start to call localStorage.</p>
<pre><code>constructor() {
  super()

77210728,Error observed in my first C language &#39;Hello World&#39; program,77233647,"<p>There are several possible issues that you may be running into.  However, I want to start with a word of caution.  I, personally, really enjoy programming, C especially, and find it very comfortable.  However, you need to make sure as a programmer, especially a C programmer, that you are paying very close attention to every detail.  You seem to be new to programming so I apologize if this is an overly complex answer.  Also, have put <strong>Definition</strong> and <strong>Declaration</strong> in bold for special attention since I find it easy to mix them up.  They are not the same thing.  See this question for more information:</p>
<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1410563/what-is-the-difference-between-a-definition-and-a-declaration"">What is the difference between a definition and a declaration?</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The first thing that I want to say is that VSCode is showing your source &quot;Hello.c&quot; file as unsaved.  I don't know if the contents shown in your screenshot truly match that which was used by your build commands.</p>
<p>The next thing is that your terminal output shows 2 errors.  The first is from your build command:</p>
<pre><code>gcc Hello.c
</code></pre>
<p>This command will attempt to both compile and then link your code into an executable program.  Since you did not specify an output name, it will default to &quot;a.exe&quot; on Windows.  On other platforms the default is usually &quot;a.out&quot;.  If you pass the <code>-c</code> option to gcc, it will attempt to only compile, not link.  Compilation and linking are 2 distinct steps.  Compilation takes the input and runs the preprocessor, then attempts to parse and convert your source code into machine code.  However, your code can refer to symbols outside of that &quot;compilation unit&quot;.  Symbols usually refer to things like functions and global variables.  Before your program can be run, it must be linked against any outside dependencies to resolve the symbols references.  For example, you are calling a function <em>printf()</em> to print &quot;Hello World&quot;.  You do not include the <strong>definition</strong> of the function <em>printf()</em> anywhere in your source code.  It is part of the C library.  During linking, the gcc will default to attempting to link against the C library and there it will be able to resolve your reference to the <em>printf()</em> function.  The only function you, in your Hello World program, provide a <strong>definition</strong> for is the function <em>main()</em>.</p>
<p>The good news is that compilation succeeded.  Compilation is the step where syntax errors and the like will be reported by the compiler.  So internally, gcc was able to compile and generate the machine code for your <em>main()</em> function.  The bad news is that the linking failed.  Linking errors are harder to parse, especially for a beginner.  In your case it was attempting to resolve a reference to a symbol called <em>WinMain</em>.  This has to do with some Windows specific stuff that I am not completely familiar with.  However, before I can explain further I need to go on another tangent.</p>
<p>When a program starts executing the operating system starts at a location referred to a the program entry point.  This is the memory address of some machine instruction within the binary machine code of a fully built program.  While as a new C programmer, you may think of the <em>main()</em> function as the start, it is not actually the entry point of the program (At least not usually or by default).</p>
<p>If it is not clear by now, gcc actually does a lot of magic behind the scenes and this can create problems for programs that have special needs or use cases, such as firmware.  Often in such cases, special CFLAGS need to be used to carefully control what gcc is actually doing.</p>
<p>One of the things that gcc does by default during linking is to link-in a precompiled object file.  The exact one depends on the type of build and this may be different on different plaforms, but usually on Linux it is some file called &quot;crt1.o&quot;.  This file contains the true entry point of the program, usually referred to by the symbol <em>_start</em>.  It initializes the C Library sets up special CPU registers, such as global pointers, etc..., and then finally calls the function <em>main().</em>  Under the typical Linux build defaults, this would get automatically linked-in.</p>
<p>So the oversimplified call graph of your Hello World program is:</p>
<ol>
<li>_start - crtn.o</li>
<li>main - your provided source code</li>
<li>printf - the C library</li>
</ol>
<p>This is again oversimplified because there are likely many calls being made within crtn.o before <em>your()</em> main function and within the <em>printf()</em> function of the C library.  Additionally, that _start is not really a function as it is usually implemented with hand Assembly, it's not really following a calling ABI, it won't return because there is no where for it to go, etc...</p>
<p>The point, however, is that your <em>main()</em> function itself is represented as a symbol within the linking process that the linker is trying to resolve between your source code and suppled pre-compiled initialization code.</p>
<p>This brings me to the Windows funniness.  By convention on Windows, a program may have one of 2 different &quot;main&quot; functions (Note the quotes, not italics).  If it is console application, it will attempt to start by calling <em>main()</em>.  If it is a GUI application it will attempt to start by calling <em>WinMain()</em>.  The main difference is that a GUI application will generally not attempt to spawn or attach a console.  You can, of course, create a GUI within a console application and spawn a terminal within a GUI application.  I have been working a GUI program, using the WinMain function but also keeping the Attach Console behavior so I can easily use print statement debugging.  I want to also make you aware that the function prototypes for <em>main()</em> and <em>WinMain()</em> are different and case-sensitive.</p>
<p>There is another question about the exact differences between <em>WinMain()</em> and <em>main()</em> here if you want to read more:
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18709403/winmain-vs-main-c"">WinMain vs. main (C++)</a></p>
<p>As a bit of an aside, <em>WinMain()</em> does not contain the traditional argc and argv parameters.  However, Windows has some hidden global symbols for them with the names __argc and __argv.  You can access them using their normal types if you are trying to write a cross-platform GUI program uses them.  If you don't know what I mean in this paragraph, don't worry.  By the time you need this, you'll understand.</p>
<p>I want to mention that it looks like you are using an older version of the MinGW GNU GCC Windows port.  You should be aware that the project was forked years ago into the MinGW-w64 project.  Your older compiler may have some behavior quirks that I am unable to replicate on the versions I am using.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Windows port of GCC has the command line options <code>-mwindows</code> and <code>-mconsole</code>.  It is likely that your older version of GCC is defaulting to <code>-mwindows</code> and you need to specify <code>-mconsole</code> to get it to try to link against <em>main</em> instead of <em>WinMain</em>.  The version of GCC that I have didn't really seem to have this issue, however.  It is also possible that your PATH variables were not setup correctly and are causing GCC to look for the wrong object files during the link.  Keep in mind, you may have to logout and login (Not lock/switch user) or even restart your computer for PATH changes to completely take effect.</p>
<p>Since your linking failed, your build failed and no program, &quot;a.exe&quot;, was created.  That is the reason for your second error message in the terminal.  That is the general command not found error of Window PowerShell.  Yes, it's very wordy.</p>
<p>Another possible quirk of your old complier is what appears to be mangled syntax.  While this worked fine for me, your complier may be choking on the syntax of your first line:</p>
<pre><code># include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Normal syntax for this is:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Lines that start with # are processed by the preprocessor.  An #include statement basically has the effect of replacing itself with the contents the file it is including.  However, I believe the # symbol is treated by the complier itself (after the preprocessing is done) as a line comment.  If you run gcc in preprocess only mode with the command flag <code>-E</code>, you will see what I mean.  You mentioned in your comments that your earlier error is now gone and that you are now getting an implicit function <strong>declaration</strong> error.  This means that you have not told the compiler about a function before you have starting using it.  The <strong>declaration</strong> of the <em>printf()</em> function is part of the &quot;stdio.h&quot; header file.  I suspect the problem above was introduced with the unsaved changes in your VSCode editor and that after your original post, you saved the file, creating that problem.  I suspect your older version of GCC is treating that line as a line comment due to the bad syntax.
Again, make sure you are paying attention to the details.</p>
<p>If you had an earlier version of GCC on your computer, make sure that your changes to the PATH take precedence.  Check the version of gcc with the command:</p>
<pre><code>gcc --version
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>A few other notes.</p>
<p>You are probably aware, but the <code>main()</code> function has some parameters that are passed to it, such as argc, argv, and envp.  It doesn't really hurt anything to not include them if you aren't going to use any of them, but it is important to fill it out completely if you intend to use any of them.</p>
<p>Also, your print statements don't include a new line.  This could be intentional.  Maybe you don't want a new line.  However, I expect this was unintentional.  In my testing, PowerShell seems to have some magic where it will add a new line even if you don't.  However, you will begin to see the problem if you write 2 consecutive lines containing:</p>
<pre><code>printf(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>On Linux, when BASH returns, it won't append a new line and therefore, your terminal prompt will be appended to the end of the last line your printed.  The print code including the new line is:</p>
<pre><code>printf(&quot;Hello World\n&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The character <code>\</code> is called a delimiter.  It allows you to have create special meaning within otherwise plain text.  For example if you wanted to put the character &quot; in the string, you would not want to have the C language treat that character as the end of the string.  So you could embed 3 double quote characters into your string like this:</p>
<pre><code>printf(&quot;He\&quot;llo W\&quot;\&quot;orld&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>You can also delimit the delimiter to write backslashes into your string with <code>\\</code>.  The <code>\n</code> has the meaning of the ASCII character 10 (New Line).  You can look it up on an ASCII Table if you are curious.  This is one of the things I like about C, very little to no magic.  You get exactly what you say.  It is very literal, down to needing to specify your own line endings.</p>
<p>Lastly, and this is not really an issue in modern times, more just a historical quirk of really old parsers.  I don't believe it is legal C to not end the file with an empty line.  Your file ends on line 6, but line 6 is not empty.  Again, it's more of a funny quirk of the language specification.  I don't know of any compiler that actually will complain or be unable to parse C source code without an empty last line.</p>

<p>It seems <code>Spring Boot</code> has modified how it initializes the <code>DataSource</code> with <code>SQL</code> scripts with <code>2.5.0</code>.</p>
<p>This can be fixed by including the following property in the project:</p>
<pre><code>spring:
  jpa:
    defer-datasource-initialization: true
</code></pre>
<p>The explanation:</p>
<p>Among the changes introduced in <strong>2.5.0</strong>, it seems now the <code>data.sql</code> script is executed before Hibernate is initialized:</p>

</ul>
<p>And since I'm relying on the ORM mechanism (i.e. Hibernate) to create the schema from the entity definition, the database table does not exist at the moment the initialization SQL script is executed.</p>
"
67695069,Spring Boot datasource initialization error with data.sql script after 2.5.0 upgrade,69550215,"<p>Add <code>spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true</code> to the <code>application.properties</code> file.</p>
<p><strong>Reason</strong>:</p>
<p>By default, the <code>data.sql</code> scripts are now run before <strong>Hibernate</strong> is initialized. This aligns the behavior of basic script-based initialization with that of <code>Flyway</code> and <code>Liquibase</code>. If you want to use <code>data.sql</code> to populate a schema created by Hibernate, set <code>spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization</code> to <strong>true</strong>. While mixing database initialization technologies is not recommended, this will also allow you to use a schema.sql script to build upon a Hibernate-created schema before it’s populated via <code>data.sql</code>.</p>

75684314,AH10411 error: Managing spaces and %20 in apache mod_rewrite,75685188,"<blockquote>
<p>(I tried $1%20$2 at the end, which also went badly).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks like a bug. Encoding the <em>space</em> as <code>%20</code> in the query string should be valid. You can also encode the <em>space</em> as <code>+</code> in the query string (as in your workaround).</p>
<p>In your original rule, Apache should be encoding the space (as <code>%20</code>) when making the internal rewrite (since a literal space is not valid in the URL). However, it would seem Apache is then baulking at the encoded space?!</p>
<p>You can also try using the <code>B</code> flag in your original rule. The <code>B</code> flag tells mod_rewrite to URL-encode the backreference before applying this to the <em>substitution</em> string. However, this would seem to be dependent on Apache encoding the space as <code>+</code> in the query string (as opposed to <code>%20</code> which it would ordinarily do). Certainly in earlier versions of Apache, this would only have resulted in Apache encoding the <em>space</em> as <code>%20</code> (not <code>+</code>), however, since version 2.4.26 Apache has introduced a new flag <code>BNP</code> (<code>backrefnoplus</code>) which explicitly informs Apache <em>not</em> to use a <code>+</code>, so you would think that by default, it would use a <code>+</code>. (Unfortunately I can't just test this myself at the moment.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(FISH\s*J[\d.]+-?\+?\d+)$ myPage.php?sourceName=$1 [B,QSA,L]
</code></pre>
<p>(Minor point... no need to backslash-escape the literal dot when used inside a regex character class. I also reduced the digit ranges to the shorthand <code>\d</code>.)</p>
<p><em>Aside:</em> Can you have both <code>-</code> and <code>+</code> before the last set of digits. It looks like it should perhaps be one or the other (or nothing at all)? eg. <code>[-+]?</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a better solution for this? i.e. how am I &quot;supposed&quot; to handle the case of spaces in a URL, when it's in a string I want to capture and pass as an argument to the underlying page?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really (although your solution is not strictly correct - see below). In your particular example, that only contains <em>spaces</em> you shouldn't <em>need</em> to do anything, as mod_rewrite should automatically URL-encode any URL that is not valid. (There is an <code>NE</code> - <code>noescape</code> - flag to explicitly prevent mod_rewrite from doing this - which is sometimes necessary to prevent already encoded characters being doubly encoded.) You can always use the <code>B</code> flag in URL-rewrites of this form (as mentioned above). You would <em>need</em> to use the <code>B</code> flag if there were other special characters, such as <code>&amp;</code> (a special character in the query string) which would not otherwise be URL-encoded (effectively resulting in the URL parameter value being truncated).</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(FISH)\s*(J[0-9\.]+-?\+?[0-9]+)$ myPage.php?sourceName=$1+$2 [L,QSA]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>An issue with your solution is that you are allowing 0 (ie. &quot;none&quot;) or more <em>spaces</em> in the request and enforcing a single <em>space</em> in the resulting URL parameter. This is not the same as your original directive, that would preserve the spaces (or lack of) from the original request.</p>
<p>Could there be 0 or more spaces in the initial request?</p>
<p>If yes, and these need to be preserved then it may just be easier to repeat this rule for as many &quot;spaces&quot; as you need. You could implement a search/replace, but that may be overkill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(In the above I am checking for spaces, not %20, as the browser seems to be converting it to space before it makes it to this rule).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The URL-path that the <code>RewriteRule</code> <em>pattern</em> matches against is first URL-decoded (%-decoded), which is why you need to match against a literal <em>space</em> and not <code>%20</code>. This has nothing to do with the &quot;browser&quot;. Any literal <em>spaces</em> in the URL-path &quot;must&quot; be URL-encoded as <code>%20</code> in the HTTP request that leaves the browser/user-agent otherwise it's simply not valid.</p>
<hr />
<h3>(UPDATE) Restrict which non-alphanumeric characters are encoded</h3>
<p>There was a comment (since <em>deleted</em>) where the user was also passing a <code>+</code> (literal plus) in the URL-path and seemingly expecting this to be passed as-is to the query string (via an internal rewrite) which would then be seen as an encoded <em>space</em>. However, the use of the <code>B</code> flag (as above) would result in the literal <code>+</code> being URL encoded as <code>%2b</code> thus preserving the literal <code>+</code> - which would ordinarily be the correct behaviour. However, if the <code>+</code> should be copied as-is and thus seen as an encoded <em>space</em> (not a literal <code>+</code>) in the resulting query string then you can restrict the non-alphanumeric characters that the <code>B</code> flag will encode (requires Apache 2.4.26+). ie. Exclude the <code>+</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, you could limit the encoding to <em>spaces</em> and <code>?</code> only. For example:</p>
<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?query=$1 &quot;[B= ?,L]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><code>+</code> will no longer be encoded in the backreference, so its special meaning in the query string (as an encoded <em>space</em>) will still apply.</p>
<p>NB: You can't encode only <em>spaces</em> (since a space cannot be used as the last character), hence the additional <code>?</code> character. Consequently, the flags argument needs to be surrounded in double quotes, since <em>spaces</em> are otherwise argument delimiters.</p>

75684314,AH10411 error: Managing spaces and %20 in apache mod_rewrite,76341864,"<p>Debugging Apache (ErrorLog with LogLevel rewrite:trace6) shows, that calling</p>
<pre><code>/FISH%20J12345.6-78919
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(FISH\s*J[0-9\.]+-?\+?[0-9]+)$ myPage.php?sourceName=$1 [L,QSA]
</code></pre>
<p>decodes the %20 correctly to Space before mod_rewrite gets it. And the URL is rewritten to</p>
<pre><code>'myPage.php?sourceName=FISH J12345.6-78919'
</code></pre>
<p>There is a Space in the query param and mod_rewrite does not like this (anymore).</p>
<p>Actually two things happen with mod_rewrite and a rule like</p>
<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]
</code></pre>
<p>First the PATH part of the URL is decoded (beware that a + in the PATH part is a +, and not decoded to a Space) and handed to mod_rewrite. This then is put to $1. The QUERY part of the original URL is not decoded, but merged into the rewritten PATH part. Then that new URL is handed back to Apache. The php then decodes the QUERY params. Which makes for a double decoding of the PATH part, as in the rewritten URL it is a QUERY param.</p>
<p>Without [B], e.g. <code>/A%2520B/?a=b%2520c</code> (%25 decoded is %) is rewritten to <code>q=A%20B/&amp;a=b%2520c</code> ending up in php as <code>&quot;q&quot; =&gt; &quot;A B/&quot;, &quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;b%20c&quot;</code>. Actually not quite what is expected at first sight (at least what I expected up to now, which was <code>&quot;q&quot; =&gt; &quot;A%20B/&quot;</code>).</p>
<p>So probably using [B] for moving PATH parts to QUERY param is the better choice anyway, ensuring it only gets decoded once.</p>
<p>With [B], <code>/A%2520B/?a=b%2520c</code> is finally rewritten to <code>q=A%2520B%2f&amp;a=b%2520c</code> ending up in php as <code>&quot;q&quot; =&gt; &quot;A%20B/&quot;, &quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;b%20c&quot;</code>. Looks better to me.</p>
<p>With [B] the FISH link gets encoded like so <code>escaping backreference 'FISH J12345.6-78919' to 'FISH+J12345%2e6%2d78919'</code>, so encoding the Space is done with the + (not %20). In php it gets decoded again.</p>
<p>I suppose, for single encoded PATH parts, not using [B] in most cases was ok, most likely because the % sign is not much used in PATH parts. Using [B] for me is now the better solution.</p>
<p>There is one caveat, answered already elsewhere here: As + is valid in the PATH part, <code>/A+%2bB/</code> is passed to mod_rewrite as <code>A++B/</code> (so the first + stays a +), finally being passed as <code>q=A%2b%2bB%2f</code> ending up in php as <code>&quot;q&quot; =&gt; &quot;A++B/&quot;</code>. This cannot be overcome, as + is handled different in PATH part than in QUERY part.</p>

<p>I also tried factory + injecting AuthService directly (through providers array, instead of using <code>ModuleRef</code>). I got a null AuthService.</p>
<p>Probably some dependency cycle on the node.js module imports, tough neither eslint or nest wouldn't say anything.</p>

17662928,"Django, creating a custom 500/404 error page",24725091,"<p>Under your main <code>views.py</code> add your own custom implementation of the following two views, and just set up the templates <strong>404.html</strong> and <strong>500.html</strong> with what you want to display.</p>

<p>With this solution, no custom code needs to be added to <code>urls.py</code></p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
from django.template import RequestContext


def handler404(request, *args, **argv):
    response = render_to_response('404.html', {},
                                  context_instance=RequestContext(request))
    response.status_code = 404
    return response


def handler500(request, *args, **argv):
    response = render_to_response('500.html', {},
                                  context_instance=RequestContext(request))
    response.status_code = 500
    return response
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p><code>handler404</code> and <code>handler500</code> are exported Django string configuration variables found in <code>django/conf/urls/__init__.py</code>. That is why the above config works.</p>

<p>To get the above config to work, you should define the following variables in your <code>urls.py</code> file and point the exported Django variables to the string Python path of where these Django functional views are defined, like so:</p>

<pre><code># project/urls.py

handler404 = 'my_app.views.handler404'
handler500 = 'my_app.views.handler500'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update for Django 2.0</strong></p>

<p>Signatures for handler views were changed in Django 2.0:
<a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/views/#error-views"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/views/#error-views</a> </p>

<p>If you use views as above, handler404 will fail with message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""handler404() got an unexpected keyword argument 'exception'""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In such case modify your views like this:</p>

<pre><code>def handler404(request, exception, template_name=""404.html""):
    response = render_to_response(template_name)
    response.status_code = 404
    return response
</code></pre>
"
17662928,"Django, creating a custom 500/404 error page",37611184,"<h1>Official answer:</h1>

<p>Here is the link to the official documentation on how to set up custom error views:</p>

<p><a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/views/#customizing-error-views"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/views/#customizing-error-views</a></p>

<p>It says to add lines like these in your URLconf (setting them anywhere else will have no effect):</p>

<pre><code>handler404 = 'mysite.views.my_custom_page_not_found_view'
handler500 = 'mysite.views.my_custom_error_view'
handler403 = 'mysite.views.my_custom_permission_denied_view'
handler400 = 'mysite.views.my_custom_bad_request_view'
</code></pre>

<p>You can also customise the CSRF error view by modifying the setting <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#csrf-failure-view"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW</code></a>.</p>

<h1>Default error handlers:</h1>

<p>It's worth reading the documentation of the default error handlers, <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/views/#the-404-page-not-found-view"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>page_not_found</code></a>, <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/views/#the-500-server-error-view"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>server_error</code></a>, <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/views/#the-403-http-forbidden-view"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>permission_denied</code></a> and <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/views/#the-400-bad-request-view"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>bad_request</code></a>. By default, they use these templates if they can find them, respectively: <code>404.html</code>, <code>500.html</code>, <code>403.html</code>, and <code>400.html</code>.</p>

<p>So if all you want to do is make pretty error pages, just create those files in a <code>TEMPLATE_DIRS</code> directory, you don't need to edit URLConf at all. Read the documentation to see which context variables are available.</p>

<p>In Django 1.10 and later, the default CSRF error view uses the template <code>403_csrf.html</code>.</p>

<h1>Gotcha:</h1>

<p>Don't forget that <code>DEBUG</code> must be set to False for these to work, otherwise, the normal debug handlers will be used.</p>

<p>After a bit of experimentation, I found that you can manually select the range of cells and click the little pop-up menu that appears and tell it to ignore all errors in the range, but this doesn't appear to have a VBA equivalent. </p>

<p>Doing this experiment with the macro recorder on records nothing, which is usually a sign that the programmer at Microsoft who implemented this functionality was incompetent.</p>

29708312,How can I use VBA to ignore green triangle error in range without looping cell by cell?,45990347,"<p>You can use workbook events to turn on and off the user's system setting, and restore the setting back to the original value when you're done.</p>

<p>In the ThisWorkbook object, put an Open event that takes note of their initial setting and then turns it off.</p>

<pre><code>Dim MyErrorCheckValue as Boolean

Private Sub Workbook_Open()
    MyErrorCheckValue = Application.ErrorCheckingOptions.NumberAsText
    Application.ErrorCheckingOptions.NumberAsText = False
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Add a BeforeClose event to set it back to original value when closing the file.</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
    Application.ErrorCheckingOptions.NumberAsText = MyErrorCheckValue
End Sub

29708312,How can I use VBA to ignore green triangle error in range without looping cell by cell?,29708386,"<p>The preferred solution would be to convert the string to a number <em>before</em> you bring it into Excel.  For example, when I am working with SQL and I have some numerical values stored as a <code>NVARCHAR</code> in the database I will use a <code>CONVERT(int, colName)</code> in the SQL statement when I am bringing it into Excel.  This brings it in as a number and I no longer get that message.</p>

<p>Now, if this sort of option isn't available to you, you can fix that error another way.  Simply set the range of values that have the number stored as text error equal to itself.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Sub Test()

    Sheets(""Sheet1"").Range(""A1:A3"").Value = Sheets(""Sheet1"").Range(""A1:A3"").Value

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>A1:A3</code> in this example is the range of values you want to no longer store as text.</p>

<p>Since your numbers have leading zeroes, you can change the formatting of these cells to add these zeroes as such:</p>

<pre><code>Sub Test()

    Sheets(""Sheet1"").Range(""A1:A3"").Value = Sheets(""Sheet1"").Range(""A1:A3"").Value
    'This assumes your numbers are 11 digits long
    'Thus 11132 would display as 00000011132
    Sheets(""Sheet1"").Range(""A1:A3"").NumberFormat = ""00000000000""

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>This will change the display to show leading zeroes again.  If you are exporting this data in any fashion you may have to take steps to ensure that this particular column is exported as text and not number, but I can't help much more without specifics.</p>

50276659,Rider Xamarin iOS error &quot;application bundle was not generated after deployment&quot;,63982062,"<p>This happened to me today on Mac OS with the release of XCode 12.0, So what fixed it for me was to TOTALLY uninstall XCode and re down the last version I had installed, V11.6 from apple developers site <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?&amp;name=Xcode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?&amp;name=Xcode</a>. After that Rider will now run the iOS simulator as normal.</p>
<p>I guess the  lesson learned is to not just update XCode until a few weeks, because I think Jetbrains need to catch up and release a newer version that works with the newer version of XCode. Of course if you need to test your app with the latest new version of iOS, then I guess you can still use VS for Mac as that still worked fine for me, but I need Rider to code, VS just doesn't do it for me at the moment</p>

<p>To summarize, some users have experienced memory, performance issues with this cartridge default settings.
This is particularly due to the fact that Openshift Wildfly cartridge enables Java EE 7 Full Profile by default (with a custom standalone.xml configuration file, not the standalone-full.xml as in default wildfly standalone configuration), which does not work well on small gears due to their limitations.</p>

<p>But a lot of Java EE 7 users only use Web Profile and do not need to enable all Java EE 7 Full Profile specs in their application actually.</p>

<p>So by enabling only Java EE 7 Web profile features and disabling Full Profile specific ones, such as messaging subsystem, you can make this cartridge work fine on a small gear.</p>

<p>Generally and without going into each OS and each environment running the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python interpreter</a> (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jupyter session</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IDE</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CLI</a>), a reboot is normally excessive. For some a reboot is not even possible.</p>
<p>Just close and re-open your environment (defined above) after the app installer completes or you have altered the PATH yourself.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping you from altering the PATH <em><strong>within</strong></em> your Python script using the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">subprocess</a> module to install the additional application or the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os#os.environ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">os</a> module, or by referencing the apps absolute path e.g.</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code># Updating the current PATH inside Python

import os
from pathlib import Path
def update_app_path(app, new_path):
    # Get the PATH environment variable
    existing = [Path(p) for p in os.environ[&quot;PATH&quot;].split(os.path.pathsep))

</code></pre>
<p>This works as Python takes a copy of the current environment when it starts and anything it then does after that, using os or shell calls, uses that copied environment.  Altering the environment within Python does not change the user's environemnt outside of that running Python, and changes in this way are not permanent unless deliberately made so.</p>

<li><p>Open an sql terminal and connect to your database:</p>

<li><p>Drop them (consider drop order with relations):</p>

<li>List migration record, you will see migrations applied classified like so:</li>
</ul>

<li><p>log out and run your migrations merely (maybe run makemigrations in your case):</p>

<p><code>python manage.py migrate --settings=your.settings.module_if_any</code></p></li>

<p>I followed my own advice from previous years (see below), and went to <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/download/more/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.apple.com/download/all</a> and downloaded
&quot;Command Line Tools for Xcode 14&quot; (You have to log in with your Apple ID and enter MFA code, so have all the devices you need for that handy. Then select &quot;Command Line Tools for Xcode 14&quot;, or if you want to get into the alphas or betas, that's up to you. But stable releases are probably the best choice for software developers.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7P2T.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7P2T.png"" alt=""developer download page selection for &quot;Command Line Tools for Xcode 14&quot;"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>You have to either download the tools from CLI or the developer page and before you can use git, you need to reboot!!! Or you will get stuck in a loop of prompt &amp; downloading</strong></p>
<p>Rebooting will break the loop and complete the installation of your CLI tools <em>including</em> git so that you can get back to work</p>
<p>Solutions for previous years, these may or may not be valid these days as the downloads page has changed significantly:</p>
<p>PREVIOUS YEARS SOLUTIONS, probably #2 is most helpful.</p>
<p>*** <strong>Solution #1</strong>:</p>
<p>Go back to your terminal and enter:</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre>
<p>You'll then receive the following output:</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools
</code></pre>
<p>You will then be prompted in a window to update Xcode Command Line tools. (which could take a while)</p>
<p>Open a new terminal window and your development tools should be returned.</p>
<p><strong>Addition:</strong> With any major or semi-major update you'll need to update the command line tools in order to get them functioning properly again. Check Xcode with any update. This goes beyond Mojave...</p>
<p><strong>After that restart your terminal</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>IF that fails,</strong> and it might.... you'll get a pop-up box saying &quot;Software not found on server&quot;, proceed to solution 2.</p>
<p>*** <strong>Solution #2</strong>: (Preferred method)</p>
<p>If you hit <code>xcode-select --install</code> and it doesn't find the software, log into Apple Developer, and install it via webpage.</p>
<p>Log in or sign up here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/download/more/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.apple.com/download/more/</a></p>
<p>Look for: <strong>&quot;Command Line Tools for Xcode 14.x&quot;</strong> in the list of downloads
Then click the dmg and download. (See previous image above) either way, you will probably wind up at an apple downloads webpage.</p>

68674897,MongoDB docker replica set connection error &quot;Host not found&quot;,68674898,"<p>There are some partial answers on this issue from various places, here is what I think as a complete answer.</p>
<h1>The Cause</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst#clients-use-the-hostnames-listed-in-the-replica-set-config-not-the-seed-list"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mongo clients use the hostnames listed in the replica set config, not the seed list</a></p>
<p>Although the connection string is <code>&quot;mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/?replicaSet=rs&quot;</code>, mongo client does not connect to the members of the replica set with seed addresses <code>localhost:27017</code> etc, instead the client connects to the members in the replica config set returned from the seed hosts, i.e., the ones in the <code>rs.initiate</code> call. This is why the error message is <code>Error connecting to mongo1:27017</code> instead of <code>Error connecting to localhost:27017</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Container hostnames are not addressable outside the container network</p>
<p>A mongo client inside the same container network as the mongo server containers can connect to the server via addresses like <code>mongo1:27017</code>; however, a client on the host, which is outside of the container network, can not resolve <code>mongo1</code> to an IP. The typical solution for this problem is proxy, see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37242217/access-docker-container-from-host-using-containers-name"">Access docker container from host using containers name</a> for details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Fix</h1>
<p>Because the problem involves docker networking and docker networking varies between Linux and Mac. The fixes are different on the two platforms.</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>The proxy fix (via 3rd party software or modifying <code>/etc/hosts</code> file) works fine but sometimes is not viable, e.g., running on remote CI hosts. A simple self-contained portable solution is to update the <code>intiate_replia_set.sh</code> script to initiate the replica set with member IPs instead of hostnames.</p>
<p><strong>intiate_replia_set.sh</strong></p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>echo &quot;Starting replica set initialization&quot;
until mongo --host mongo1 --eval &quot;print(\&quot;waited for connection\&quot;)&quot;
do
   sleep 2
done
echo &quot;Connection finished&quot;
echo &quot;Creating replica set&quot;

MONGO1IP=$(getent hosts mongo1 | awk '{ print $1 }')
MONGO2IP=$(getent hosts mongo2 | awk '{ print $1 }')
MONGO3IP=$(getent hosts mongo3 | awk '{ print $1 }')

read -r -d '' CMD &lt;&lt;EOF
rs.initiate(
  {
    _id : 'rs',
    members: [
      { _id : 0, host : '${MONGO1IP}:27017' },
      { _id : 1, host : '${MONGO2IP}:27017' },
      { _id : 2, host : '${MONGO3IP}:27017' }
    ]
  }
)
EOF

echo $CMD | mongo --host mongo1
echo &quot;replica set created&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This way the mongo replica set members have container IP instead of hostname in their addresses. And the container IP is reachable from the host.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can assign static IP to each container explicitly in the docker-compose file, and use static IPs when initiating the replica set. It is a similar fix but with more work.</p>
<h2>Mac</h2>
<p>The above solution unfortunately does not work for Mac, because docker container IP on Mac is not exposed on the host network interface. <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#per-container-ip-addressing-is-not-possible"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#per-container-ip-addressing-is-not-possible</a></p>
<p>The easiest way to make it work is to add following mapping in <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>127.0.0.1   mongo1 mongo2 mongo3
</code></pre>
"
68674897,MongoDB docker replica set connection error &quot;Host not found&quot;,77222796,"<p>Additional information for <code>docker compose</code> users.</p>
<p>To catch above situation, use <code>healthcheck</code>, that utilizes <code>ping</code> with URL explicitely defining <code>replicaSet=</code></p>

<li><p>NumPy <strong>1.20</strong> <a href=""https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations"" rel=""noreferrer"">(release notes)</a> deprecated <code>numpy.float</code>, <code>numpy.int</code>, and similar aliases, causing them to issue a deprecation warning</p>
</li>
<li><p>NumPy <strong>1.24</strong> <a href=""https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/1.24.0-notes.html#expired-deprecations"" rel=""noreferrer"">(release notes)</a> removed these aliases altogether, causing an <em><strong>error</strong></em> when they are used</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases you can simply replace the deprecated NumPy types by the equivalent Python built-in type, e.g., <code>numpy.float</code> becomes a &quot;plain&quot; Python <code>float</code>.</p>
<p>For detailed guidelines on how to deal with various deprecated types, have a closer look at the table and guideline in the <a href=""https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations"" rel=""noreferrer"">release notes for 1.20</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<p>To give a clear guideline for the vast majority of cases, for the types <code>bool</code>, <code>object</code>, <code>str</code> (and <code>unicode</code>) using the plain version is shorter and clear, and generally a good replacement. For <code>float</code> and <code>complex</code> you can use <code>float64</code> and <code>complex128</code> if you wish to be more explicit about the precision.</p>
<p>For <code>np.int</code> a direct replacement with <code>np.int_</code> or <code>int</code> is also good and will not change behavior, but the precision will continue to depend on the computer and operating system. If you want to be more explicit and review the current use, you have the following alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>np.int64</code> or <code>np.int32</code> to specify the precision exactly. This ensures that results cannot depend on the computer or operating system.</li>
<li><code>np.int_</code> or <code>int</code> (the default), but be aware that it depends on the computer and operating system.</li>
<li>The C types: <code>np.cint</code> (<code>int</code>), <code>np.int_</code> (<code>long</code>), <code>np.longlong</code>.</li>
<li><code>np.intp</code> which is 32bit on 32bit machines 64bit on 64bit machines. This can be the best type to use for indexing.</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have dependencies that use the deprecated types, a quick workaround would be to roll back your NumPy  version to 1.24 or less (as suggested in some of the other answers), while waiting for the dependency to catch up. Alternatively, you could create a patch yourself and open a pull request, or monkey patch the dependency in your own code.</p>

In your Controller classes, when you use <code>@RequestMapping</code> on class, no leading slash (e.g. <code>@RequestMapping(""property"")</code>).

<p>What I discovered:
I added, as I proposed, MESSAGE(${QT_INCLUDES}) to my CMakeLists.txt. This revealed something very interesting: All my Qt includes pointed to an old Qt 4.8.2, which did not exist on my machine anymore. Even when I added a new kit and ran CMake, it did not update CMakeCache.txt. The kit was connected to my recent Qt 4.8.5, but cmake 'found' Qt 4.8.2. I solved my problem by deleting the old CMakeCache.txt </p>

<p>When QtCreator did not find CMakeCache.txt, it created its own. But not where I had my old, outdated one, but in the build folder. So maybe this is the explanation, why your commandline works, but not the QtCreator: There are two different QMakeCache.txt files. On commandline you use a correct one, the QtCreator uses its own outdated.</p>

<p>A wheel is a built package that contains the necessary files for a Python package, and it allows for faster installation. Building a wheel for a package involves compiling the package's code, which can sometimes fail due to various reasons.</p>
<p>Here are a few things you can try to solve the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Try installing the package again with the <code>--no-binary :all:</code> option.
This will force pip to build the package from the source, which may
resolve any issues with the pre-built wheel. The command would look
like this: <code>pip install prophet --no-binary :all:</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure your system has all the necessary dependencies and build
tools installed. Prophet requires a C++ compiler and Python
development headers. Try using a virtual environment to install the
package.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure you have the latest version of pip and python installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check if there is any issue related to it on GitHub</p>

<p>it is a <em>required</em> field, therefore it is rendered in the template as that, so the browser ask it to be filled.</p>

<p>You have to add the attribute:</p>

<pre><code>telefono = models.CharField(
    max_length=15, 
    validators=[phone_regex], 
    verbose_name='Teléfono',
    blank=True
)
</code></pre>

<p>Also you could, instead of create a field for regex, create a library with a function, so you could reuse it on other models.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Validators are not meant to be in the model definition, as it is a representation of a table, and a regex field is not a field of a table.</p>

<p>You could create a folder with an <code>__init__.py</code> so it can be called from your apps</p>

<pre><code>root_folder/
    myapp/
    myvalidators/
       __init__.py
       myvalidators.py
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>myvalidators.py</code> you create functions or constant with the validations you need:</p>

<p><strong>myvalidators.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>REGEX_PATTERN_PHONE = your_regex
MSG_PHONE_NOT_VALID = your_message
</code></pre>

<p>In your models then add the validation pattern with <code>RegexValidator</code></p>

<pre><code>from myvalidators import myvalidators

...  
telefono = models.CharField(
    max_length=15, 
    validators=[phone_regex], 
    verbose_name='Teléfono',
    blank=True,
    validators = [RegexValidator(myvalidators.REGEX_PATTERN_PHONE, myvalidators.MSG_PHONE_NOT_VALID)],
)
...

<p>With this approach you can reuse the regex on any app or project, and in different fields that have to be validated the same way.</p>

<p>There are also limits that can be imposed by the server, such as Apache: <a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody</a></p>

<p>To truly see what's going on, you should probably check your webserver logs, check the browser upload limit (if you're using firefox), and try seeing if <code>print_r($_FILES)</code> generates any useful error numbers. If all else fails, try the net traffic monitor in firebug. The key is to determine if the request is even going to the server, and if it is what the request (including headers) looks like. Once you've gotten that far in the chain, then you can go back and see how PHP is handling the upload.</p>

I mean, the browser console may not understand them at all, and Windows command line displays them properly only in Windows 10.</p>

<p>Generally you should avoid throwing ANSI-colored error messages, as it may not work on every system, and thus is a bad practice. Nevertheless <code>throw</code> alone should not break the sequence, as it is just a string of ASCII characters.</p>

<p>What may break it is console itself not understanding it. What you have pasted (<code>?[31msome error messages?[39m</code>) differs from a valid ANSI-colored text only by replacing the escape character (ASCII code 27) with ""?"". Thus I suspect you are trying to display the text in a console not suitable of interpreting ANSI codes. Use Windows 10 console or any Unix/Linux/MacOS X system console and it will work. In the consoles of webbrowsers and in Windows versions prior to 10 it won't.</p>

<p>Server <strong>Functions</strong>, not to be confused with Server <em>Components</em>. I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that your</p>

<p>function is in a file with &quot;use server&quot; at the top, making it a Server Action (or Server Function, as its called in the error message).</p>
<p>THAT is what cannot be called during initial render. Server Actions are intended to be called as part of user interactions. A user clicks a button, which calls a server action.</p>
<p>Server actions are special, and result in a network roundtrip. THAT is why React will not let you call them during initial render.</p>
<p>So have the function which fetches data not be a server action, and this should work for you.</p>

76761493,React Server Component Error: Server Functions can not be called during initial render,76761777,"<p>The issue you're facing is due to the way React Server Components (RSC) work. They're not designed to fetch data during the initial render to avoid a &quot;fetch waterfall&quot; scenario, which can slow down your app's rendering.</p>
<p>In your case, CampaignActions is trying to fetch data during its initial render, hence the error. Even though it's a server component, it's still not allowed to fetch data at this stage.</p>
<p>A good way to solve this is to fetch the data higher up in your component tree and pass it down as props. This way, the data is fetched once and can be used by multiple components, improving performance. Alternatively, consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX to manage your app's state.</p>
<p>Your approach isn't necessarily wrong, but due to the constraints of RSCs, it's causing issues. Fetching data in the component that needs it might seem convenient, but it can lead to performance issues and more complex state management. So, it's generally better to fetch data at a higher level and pass it down as props. Hope this helps!</p>

11074868,Android - adb tcpip error,13008314,"<p>I've been having the same issue with my unrooted device. And contrary to popular belief it seems that <code>adb tcpip &lt;port&gt;</code> requires either an emulator or a debug build or root privileges; at least according to the source code.</p>

<p>master branch: <a href=""https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/master/adb/adb.c#L898"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/master/adb/adb.c#L898</a> look at <code>should_drop_privileges</code> which prevents <a href=""https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/master/adb/adb.c#L966"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/master/adb/adb.c#L966</a> <code>adb_main</code> to open a TCP/IP socket connection.</p>

<p>In older branches the logic for identifying the privileges of <code>adbd</code> were in <code>adb_main</code> itself. See: <a href=""https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/froyo-release/adb/adb.c#L860"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/froyo-release/adb/adb.c#L860</a></p>

<p>So, to further prove that <code>adbd</code> won't enter TCP/IP mode (even though <code>adb tcpip</code> gives out no errors), look at the following:</p>

<p><code>adb shell getprop | grep 'ro.secure\|debuggable\|qemu'</code>, output for my device:</p>

<pre><code>[ro.secure]: [1]
[ro.debuggable]: [0]
</code></pre>

<p>This does not meet the conditions of being able to get a <code>secure</code> value of 0 in <code>adbd</code>, since I'm not running an emulator (which needs TCP/IP by default), I'm not running a debuggable build of Android, and I'm not root.</p>

<p>Furthermore if you issue an <code>adb shell netstat</code> command you'll see that there's nobody listening on port 5037 or 5555 or whatever else you supplied to the <code>tcpip</code> command as expected from an <code>adbd</code> running in TCP/IP mode.</p>

<p>Hope this helps, good luck!</p>
"
11074868,Android - adb tcpip error,14307504,"<p>The ability to restart adbd using tcpip transport can vary from device to device. Without knowing exactly which device you're using it's very difficult to know the exact cause.</p>

<p>I tested ""adb tcpip 5555"" on a Galaxy Nexus (takju) running 4.2.1 and found it to work. I also tested on a couple other devices and those did not work.</p>

<p>I managed to get it to work using root access on a Motorola Droid 3. Note that ro.secure=1 and ro.debuggable=0 still. I simply by manually set service.adb.tcp.port"" to ""5555"" as such:</p>

<pre>
    devbox:~/droid3$ adb shell
    shell@cdma_solana:/$ getprop | grep 'ro.secure\|debuggable\|qemu'
    [ro.secure]: [1]
    [ro.debuggable]: [0]
    shell@cdma_solana:/$ su -c 'setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555'
    shell@cdma_solana:/$ exit
    devbox:~/droid3$ adb tcpip 5555
    restarting in TCP mode port: 5555
    devbox:~/droid3$ adb connect 172.16.0.14
    connected to 172.16.0.14:5555
    devbox:~/droid3$ adb -s 172.16.0.14:5555 shell
    shell@cdma_solana:/$
</pre>

<p>Although I specified 5555 when running ""adb tcpip"" it gets ignored by the device. It seems that this particular device does not have the required access to set the ""service.adb.tcp.port"" property without root.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can go back to USB as such:</p>

<pre>
    shell@cdma_solana:/$ getprop | grep adb
    [persist.service.adb.enable]: [1]
    [ro.sys.atvc_allow_all_adb]: [0]
    [persist.adb.tcp.port]: []
    [init.svc.adbd]: [running]
    [service.adb.tcp.port]: [5555]
    shell@cdma_solana:/$ su -c 'setprop service.adb.tcp.port """"'
    shell@cdma_solana:/$ exit
    devbox:~/droid3$ adb -s 172.16.0.14:5555 usb
    restarting in USB mode
    devbox:~/droid3$ adb shell
    shell@cdma_solana:/$
</pre>

<p>The reasons that this might not work on other devices vary.</p>

<p>On the Galaxy Nexus I tested, the shell user is able to set the ""service.adb.tcp.port"" property. It's not clear why this differs at this time.</p>

<p>Interestingly it seems the droid3 will not continue to listen on USB if you enable TCPIP. However, the Galaxy Nexus will.</p>

<p><strong>The Technical Details</strong> </p>

<p>Listen uses inotify by default on Linux to monitor directories for changes. It's not uncommon to encounter a system limit on the number of files you can monitor. For example, Ubuntu Lucid's (64bit) inotify limit is set to 8192.</p>

<p>You can get your current inotify file watch limit by executing:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
</code></pre>

<p>When this limit is not enough to monitor all files inside a directory, the limit must be increased for Listen to work properly.</p>

<p>You can set a new limit temporary with:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
$ sudo sysctl -p
</code></pre>

<p>If you like to make your limit permanent, use:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
$ sudo sysctl -p
</code></pre>

<p>You may also need to pay attention to the values of <code>max_queued_events</code> and <code>max_user_instances</code> if listen keeps on complaining.</p>

  <p>The issue stems from the unexpected $(TargetDir) found in the property page under Link->OutputFile. During the build process, we tried to expand the OutputFile to a fullpath but only got an empty value. Thus, it led to the index out-of-bound exception.</p>

I recommend that you check if that is the case for you, too, because if so, the other answer provides the preferred solution.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/56134376/4850949"">This answer</a> helped me with docker as well:</p>
<p>After</p>
<pre><code>sudo aa-remove-unknown
</code></pre>
<p>the problem was instantly gone and <code>docker stop</code> would work again as expected. See: <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/aa-remove-unknown.8.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">aa-remove-unknown - remove unknown AppArmor profiles</a></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>As far as I understand it, the problem cause is that the docker package does not install a profile for docker in the AppArmor service, so docker is categorized as 'unknown' by AppArmor. The above command removes the profile for all unknown applications, so they are no longer restricted by AppArmor.</p>
<p>Of course, the correct way would be to keep the profile for unknown applications and create an AppArmor profile for docker. According to the <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">docker docs on AppArmor security profiles for Docker</a>, &quot;A profile for the Docker Engine daemon exists but it is not currently installed&quot;.</p>
"
51729836,Error response from daemon: cannot stop container - signaling init process caused &quot;permission denied&quot;,51784602,"<p>I'm going to disagree with everyone suggesting sudo. The docker command sends api calls to the daemon, and if you needed sudo to run the command, you would know from the failure to connect to the docker socket. The daemon itself should be running as root.</p>

<p>The permission error to me looks like something that could be caused by an AppArmor policy or it could just be a bug in the engine/containerd/runc. You are also running Ubuntu 18.04 which docker only recently added support, so if possible, try running a slightly older version of Ubuntu LTS, or see if one of the edge/nightly builds fixes the issue. In the short term, you may have luck restarting the docker engine (<code>systemctl restart docker</code>) and possibly the entire host to see if that clears up the issue.</p>
"

This may not always be the case, so I keep the old answer, too.</em></p>
<h2>Concurrent docker installations</h2>
<p>The issue can be caused by docker being installed through <strong>apt</strong> and <strong>snap</strong> at the same time.</p>
<p>In my case, I had installed docker via apt, but accidentally another install via snap happened. This can happen because, on Ubuntu, apt is configured to use snap under the hood, unless you disable it (see <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/1410690/657482"">this answer</a> and <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/1345385/657482"">this question</a> on how to prevent this). After that, the &quot;permission denied&quot; issues started appearing, as described in the question.</p>
<h3>How to check</h3>
<p>In order to check if that's the case, check the snap installs, as in this example:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo snap list | grep docker
docker  20.10.17       2285   latest/stable  canonical✓  -
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that snap has installed docker 20.10.17.</p>
<p>Now check the apt installs, like so:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt list --installed | grep docker

WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.

docker-ce-cli/focal,now 5:20.10.21~3-0~ubuntu-focal amd64 [installed]
docker-ce-rootless-extras/focal,now 5:20.10.21~3-0~ubuntu-focal amd64 [installed,automatic]
docker-ce/focal,now 5:20.10.21~3-0~ubuntu-focal amd64 [installed]
docker-scan-plugin/focal,now 0.21.0~ubuntu-focal amd64 [installed,automatic]
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that apt has installed docker 20.10.21. This was the one that got executed, but somehow the snap install was interfering with it.</p>
<h3>How to fix</h3>
<p>The problem can be fixed by removing the snap install:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo snap remove docker
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, this command would hang. To check:</p>
<pre><code>$ snap changes
ID   Status  Spawn               Ready  Summary
6    Doing   today at 15:19 CET  -      Remove &quot;docker&quot; snap
</code></pre>
<p>The status should be 'Done'. If it stays 'Doing', you can abort it via</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo snap abort 6
</code></pre>
<p>where 6 is the number from the ID column of the previous command output.</p>
<p>Then, try removing it forcely (should always work):</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo snap remove --purge docker
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I recommend to reboot and check again, but after the snap installation has been removed, Docker should usually instantly be back to working as expected.</p>
<hr />
<p>You may prefer to keep the snap installation rather than the apt installation, which may work equally well, but I haven't tried it.</p>

In general, if you want to expose your code to someone else, you should either have <code>Must-</code> and a regular version of the method, or your methods/functions should give the client a chance to recover the way they want and so <code>error</code> should be available to them in a <code>go</code>-idiomatic way.<br />
Having said that, I agree that if your API/library is used inappropriately, it's Ok to panic as well. As a matter of fact, I've also seen methods like <code>MustGetenv()</code> that will panic if a critical env.var is missing. Fail-fast mechanism basically.</p>

<p><strong>Error was:</strong></p>

<p><em>Can't move focus to the control because it is invisible, not enabled, or of a type that does not accept the focus.</em></p>

<p><strong>How to Fix</strong></p>

<p><em>1. Select the object with the problem, e.g. the Form or Control.</em></p>

<p><em>2. In the properties windows, select the name of the object and rename adding an ""x"" to the end, e.g.  Rename CPanel to CPanelx.</em></p>

<p><em>3. Save the Form.</em></p>

<p><em>4.Now rename the CPanelx back to CPanel.</em></p>

<p><em>5. Run your form.</em></p>

<p><em>6. Problem solved.</em></p>

<p><em>Something screwy with Excel VBA, not sure what !, but this will get you working again.
Steve D.</em></p>

<p>and then someone else described the underlying problem, but his solution involved using design mode, which seems like it is maybe defeating the purpose of automating in vba, but the moderator seemed to like his answer better, so here that is as well</p>

<p><em>In normal use activeX controls are intended only to be activated, not selected, there's a difference. If you partifcularly want to Select the control (manually or with code), try putting Excel into Design mode first.</em></p>

<p>I think it would depend on how are /dev/shm and /tmp mounted.
If they are both mounted as tmpfs I'm assuming there won't be any difference.
if for some reason /tmp is not mapped as tmpfs (and I think is mapped as tmpfs by default by systemd), chrome shared memory management always maps files into memory when creating an anonymous shared files, so even in that case shouldn't be much difference. I guess you could force telemetry tests with the flag enabled and see how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As for why not use by default, it was a pushed back by the shared memory team, I guess it makes sense it should be useing /dev/shm for shared memory by default.</p>

64073138,GKE Error: listen EACCES: permission denied on any port,77207202,"<p>I got the same issue on EKS. Same as your situation, the problem is because of automatic environment variable injection from the service name.</p>
<p>Back to your question context, the service name is <code>api</code>, with selector to the pod <code>api</code>.<br />
K8s will inject the service host and port with the following service environment variables (see <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-environment/#cluster-information"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cluster Information</a>)</p>
<pre><code>API_SERVICE_HOST=&lt;the host the service is running on&gt;
API_SERVICE_PORT=&lt;the port the service is running on&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But wait, <strong>that's not all!</strong>. K8s also create variables that are compatible with Docker Engine's &quot;legacy container links&quot; feature.<br />
From <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#environment-variables"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">k8s Service Networking - Environment Variable source</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a Pod is run on a Node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables for each active Service. It adds {SVCNAME}_SERVICE_HOST and {SVCNAME}_SERVICE_PORT variables, where the Service name is upper-cased and dashes are converted to underscores. It also supports variables (see <a href=""https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dd2d12f6dc0e654c15d5db57a5f9f6ba61192726/pkg/kubelet/envvars/envvars.go#L72"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">makeLinkVariables</a>) that are compatible with Docker Engine's <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/network/links/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">&quot;legacy container links&quot;</a> feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, here are the complete list of environment variable of <code>api</code> service that will be automatically created and injected to your <code>api</code> pod (you can see the <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#environment-variables"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example of redis-primary service in the original K8s doc</a> above as well).</p>
<pre><code>API_SERVICE_HOST = 10.3.253.94
API_SERVICE_PORT = 3000

API_PORT=tcp://10.3.253.94:3000   # @thang: This is the env var that cause the exception
API_PORT_3000_TCP=tcp://10.3.253.94:3000
API_PORT_3000_TCP_PROTO=tcp
API_PORT_3000_TCP_PORT=3000
API_PORT_3000_TCP_ADDR=10.3.253.94
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the auto generated env include the <code>API_PORT</code> variable, which conflict with your env name variable name</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ENV API_PORT 3000</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This env naming conflict causes the pod resolve the incorrect <code>API_PORT</code> value and throw the pod starting exception.</p>
<p>In order to fix this issue, (as already pointed out by @Anonymous answer above), you either have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename the <code>api</code> service to another name, to avoid env variable pattern conflict</li>
<li>Or use a different env variable name for the port, e.g: <code>API_PORT_NUMBER</code></li>
</ul>

72746328,500 error for stripe webhook event checkout.session.completed,72765622,"<p>I just happen to be writing the exact same feature as you so I'm glad this popped up in my queue.</p>
<p>From taking a quick look at the code nothing stands out much. If we know that the only event that doesn't work is <code>checkout.session.completed</code>, and that's the only one we're even processing, that narrows the problem down a bit... so here's what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>I copied your implementation into a controller in my Rails API project, then used the <a href=""https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli?locale=en-GB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stripe CLI</a> to listen for, and forward Stripe events to the new endpoint:</li>
</ol>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>$ stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/webhook_events
</code></pre>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>I commented out the actual handling of the event so it was only processing the event.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I then used the Stripe CLI in a new terminal to trigger a <code>checkout.session.completed</code> event:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>$ stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
</code></pre>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>Once I did this, my API responded with a <code>201</code> and Stripe was happy.</li>
</ol>
<p>So after all of that, as the previous answer suggests, I think the issue lies with your updating the <code>Booking</code> model, so I have a few suggestions to make working with webhooks in general easier:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ideally, your controller should respond with a <code>2xx</code> to Stripe as soon as you've verified the authenticity of the event with the Stripe gem.</li>
<li>Once you've completed that, I would immediately move the processing of the event to a background job using ActiveJob.</li>
<li>In the background job, you know that your event is valid and that the session completed successfully, so now you can start to update your <code>Booking</code> model. The arguments to the job could be as simple as just the Stripe checkout session ID.</li>
<li>Finally, splitting the responsibilities like this will make writing tests much easier (and will catch what the actual problem is!).</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this helps, good luck!</p>

48522615,Docker error: invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase,52818152,"<p>A &quot;reference&quot; in docker is a pointer to an image. It may be an image name, an image ID, include a registry server in the name, use a sha256 tag to pin the image, and anything else that can be used to point to the image you want to run.</p>
<p>The <code>invalid reference format</code> error message means docker cannot convert the string you've provided to an image. This may be an invalid name, or it may be from a parsing error earlier in the <code>docker run</code> command line if that's how you run the image.</p>
<p>If the name itself is invalid, the <code>repository name must be lowercase</code> means you use upper case characters in your registry or repository name, e.g. <code>YourImageName:latest</code> should be <code>yourimagename:latest</code>.</p>
<p>With the <code>docker run</code> command line, this is often the result in not quoting parameters with spaces, missing the value for an argument, and mistaking the order of the command line. The command line is ordered as:</p>
<pre><code>docker ${args_to_docker} run ${args_to_run} image_ref ${cmd_to_exec}
</code></pre>
<p>The most common error in passing args to the run is a volume mapping expanding a path name that includes a space in it, and not quoting the path or escaping the space. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>docker run -v $(pwd):/data image_ref
</code></pre>
<p>Where if you're in the directory <code>/home/user/Some Project Dir</code>, that would define an anonymous volume <code>/home/user/Some</code> in your container, and try to run <code>Project:latest</code> with the command <code>Dir:/data image_ref</code>. And the fix is to quote the argument:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -v &quot;$(pwd):/data&quot; image_ref
</code></pre>
<p>Other common places to miss quoting include environment variables:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -e SOME_VAR=Value With Spaces image_ref
</code></pre>
<p>which docker would interpret as trying to run the image <code>With:latest</code> and the command <code>Spaces image_ref</code>. Again, the fix is to quote the environment parameter:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -e &quot;SOME_VAR=Value With Spaces&quot; image_ref
</code></pre>
<p>With a compose file, if you expand a variable in the image name, that variable may not be expanding correctly. So if you have:</p>
<pre class=""lang-yaml prettyprint-override""><code>version: 2
services:
  app:
    image: ${your_image_name}
</code></pre>
<p>Then double check that <code>your_image_name</code> is defined to an all lower case string.</p>

<p>I'd add to what Ken said and make sure you've thoroughly tested the API and resources in the console and also on the deployed version using Postman or some other client that isn't a browser. I expect there is an issue with the API itself and that your CORS configuration is correct.</p>

34325009,AWS API Gateway endpoint gives CORS error when POST from static site on S3,39990402,"<p>I was struggling with the same issue when 'POST' to API Gateway. But I found the fix for the issue. </p>

<p>After enabling CORS for the method resource, and after adding the necessary Headers e.g. 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' = '*' wildcard, and it still fails.</p>

<p>Go to OPTIONS of that resource you are invoking, 'GET', 'POST', etc..click the ""Method Request"" pane of that resource, set API Key = FALSE, do NOT have the API Key set to true. This will cause the CORS error.</p>

<p>Reason, OPTIONS is technically not a method, it a browser function to execute the Preflight request, thus during the Preflight the browser does not know what API key to send, it will know only know after the response is return to the browser of 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' = '*' then it will look up the code for the HTTP req to setHeaders of the X-Api-Key = some value. </p>

<p>Note: the invoke method itself, 'POST', etc.. can have the API Key = True, which is perfectly fine. </p>

<ol>

<p>The CORS errors were thrown because my Angular app was trying to call the functions in the cloud, but the functions hadn't been deployed to the cloud. I hadn't put in <code>connectFunctionsEmulator()</code> so the functions weren't running in the emulator.</p>
<p>In other words, the CORS error were a red herring that sent me down a rabbit hole. If the error had said, &quot;No such function found in the Firebase cloud and no emulator is connected,&quot; I would've figured out the error quickly.</p>

26368288,How do I stop iteration and return an error when Iterator::map returns a Result::Err?,63120052,"<p>The accepted answer shows how to stop on error while <em>collecting</em>, and that's fine because that's what the OP requested. If you need processing that also works on large or infinite fallible iterators, read on.</p>
<p>As already noted, <code>for</code> can be used to emulate stop-on-error, but that is sometimes inelegant, as when you want to call <code>max()</code> or other method that consumes the iterator. In other situations it's next to impossible, as when the iterator is consumed by code in another crate, such as <code>itertools</code> or <a href=""https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelBridge.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rayon</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<h2>Iterator consumer: <code>try_for_each</code></h2>
<p>When you control how the iterator is consumed, you can just use <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.try_for_each"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>try_for_each</code></a> to stop on first error. It accepts a closure that returns a <code>Result</code>, and <code>try_for_each()</code> will return <code>Ok(())</code> if the closure returned <code>Ok</code> every time, and the first <code>Err</code> on the first error. This allows the closure to detect errors simply by using the <code>?</code> operator in the natural way:</p>
<pre><code>use std::{fs, io};

fn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    fs::read_dir(&quot;/&quot;)?.try_for_each(|e| -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, e?.path().display());
        Ok(())
    })?;
    // ...
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to maintain state between the invocations of the closure, you can also use <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.try_fold"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>try_fold</code></a>. Both methods are implemented by <a href=""https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelIterator.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ParallelIterator</code></a>, so the same pattern works with Rayon.</p>
<p><code>try_for_each()</code> does require that you control how the iterator is consumed. If that is done by code not under your control - for example, if you are passing the iterator to <code>itertools::merge()</code> or similar, you will need an adapter.</p>
<h2>Iterator adapter: <code>scan</code></h2>
<p>The first attempt at stopping on error is to use <code>take_while</code>:</p>
<pre><code>use std::{io, fs};

fn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    fs::read_dir(&quot;/&quot;)?
        .take_while(Result::is_ok)
        .map(Result::unwrap)
        .for_each(|e| println!(&quot;{}&quot;, e.path().display()));
    // ...
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but we don't get any indication that an error occurred, the iteration just silently stops. Also it requires the unsightly <code>map(Result::unwrap)</code> which makes it seem like the program will panic on error, which is in fact not the case as we stop on error.</p>
<p>Both issues can be addressed by switching from <code>take_while</code> to <code>scan</code>, a more powerful combinator that not only supports stopping the iteration, but passes its callback owned items, allowing the closure to extract the error to the caller:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let mut err = Ok(());
    fs::read_dir(&quot;/&quot;)?
        .scan(&amp;mut err, |err, res| match res {
            Ok(o) =&gt; Some(o),
            Err(e) =&gt; {
                **err = Err(e);
                None
            }
        })
        .for_each(|e| println!(&quot;{}&quot;, e.path().display()));
    err?;
    // ...
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>If needed in multiple places, the closure can be abstracted into a utility function:</p>
<pre><code>fn until_err&lt;T, E&gt;(err: &amp;mut &amp;mut Result&lt;(), E&gt;, item: Result&lt;T, E&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
    match item {
        Ok(item) =&gt; Some(item),
        Err(e) =&gt; {
            **err = Err(e);
            None
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>...in which case we can invoke it as <code>.scan(&amp;mut err, until_err)</code> (<a href=""https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=180ae84ca67c3c51b7c9e6b11a1c5b8d"" rel=""noreferrer"">playground</a>).</p>
<p>These examples trivially exhaust the iterator with <code>for_each()</code>, but one can chain it with arbitrary manipulations, including Rayon's <code>par_bridge()</code>. Using <code>scan()</code> it is even possible to <code>collect()</code> the items into a container and have access to the items seen before the error, which is sometimes useful and unavailable when collecting into <code>Result&lt;Container, Error&gt;</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup> Needing to use <code>par_bridge()</code> comes up when using Rayon to process streaming data in parallel:</p>
<pre><code>fn process(input: impl BufRead + Send) -&gt; std::Result&lt;Output, Error&gt; {
    let mut err = Ok(());
    let output = lines
        .input()
        .scan(&amp;mut err, until_err)
        .par_bridge()
        .map(|line| ... executed in parallel ... )
        .reduce(|item| ... also executed in parallel ...);
    err?;
    ...
    Ok(output)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, equivalent effect cannot be trivially achieved by collecting into <code>Result</code>.</p>

<p>What if we have a <code>.map()</code> within a <code>.map()</code> within a <code>.map()</code>?</p>
<p>Here's an example for the specific case where the <code>.map()</code> operations are nested. The problem it solves is how to propagate a failure from the innermost closure while avoiding using <code>.unwrap()</code> which aborts the application.</p>
<p>This approach also enables using <code>?</code> syntax at the outer layer to capture the error if one occurs, or unwrap the result to assign to a variable if no error occurred. <code>?</code> can't otherwise be used from inside the closures.</p>
<p><code>.parse()</code> as it's used below will return <code>Result&lt;T, ParseIntError&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre class=""lang-rust prettyprint-override""><code>use std::error::Error;

</code></pre>
<p>Note that the outer <code>.collect::&lt;..&gt;()</code> generic expression specifies <code>Result&lt;Vec&lt;Vec&lt;..&gt;&gt;</code>. The inner <code>.collect()</code> will be producing <code>Result</code>s, which are stripped away by the outer <code>Result</code> as it takes the <code>Ok</code> contents and produces the 2-D vector.</p>
<p>Without relying heavily on type inference, the inner <code>.collect()</code> generic expression would look like this:</p>
<pre class=""lang-rust prettyprint-override""><code>          .collect::&lt;Result&lt;Vec&lt;i32&gt;, _&gt;&gt;()) // &lt;--- Inner.
    .collect::&lt;Result&lt;Vec&lt;Vec&lt;i32&gt;&gt;, _&gt;&gt;()?; // &lt;--- Outer.
</code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>?</code> syntax, the variable, <code>data</code>, will be assigned this 2-D vector; or the <code>main()</code> function will return a parsing error that originated from within the inner closure.</p>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
</code></pre>
<p>Taking it a step further, parse results nested three levels deep can be handled this way.</p>

12693089,"PG::Error: SELECT DISTINCT, ORDER BY expressions must appear in select list",18367248,"<p>I know this is a rather old question, but I just went through a small example in my head which helped me understand why Postgres has this seemingly odd restriction on SELECT DISTINCT / ORDER BY columns.</p>

<p>Imagine you have the following data in your Rsvp table:</p>

<pre><code> event_id |        start_time
----------+------------------------
    0     | Mar 17, 2013  12:00:00
    1     |  Jan 1, 1970  00:00:00
    1     | Aug 21, 2013  16:30:00
    2     |  Jun 9, 2012  08:45:00
</code></pre>

<p>Now you want to grab a list of distinct event_ids, ordered by their respective start_times. But where should <code>1</code> go? Should it come first, because the one tuple starts on Jan 1, 1970, or should it go last because of the Aug 21, 2013?</p>

<p>As the database system can't make that decision for you and the syntax of the query can't depend on the actual data it might be operating on (assuming <code>event_id</code> is unique), we are restricted to ordering only by columns from the <code>SELECT</code> clause.</p>

<p>As for the actual question - an alternative to Matthew's answer is using an aggregate function like <code>MIN</code> or <code>MAX</code> for the sorting:</p>

<pre><code>  SELECT event_id
    FROM Rsvp
GROUP BY event_id
ORDER BY MIN(start_time)
</code></pre>

<p>The explicit grouping and aggregation on <code>start_time</code> permit the database to come up with a unambiguous ordering of the result tuples. Note however, that readability is definitely an issue in this case ;)</p>
"
12693089,"PG::Error: SELECT DISTINCT, ORDER BY expressions must appear in select list",12693353,"<p>The ORDER BY clause can only be applied <em>after</em> the DISTINCT has been applied.  Since only the fields in the SELECT statement are taken into consideration for the DISTINCT operations, those are the only fields may be used in the ORDER BY.</p>

<p>Logically, if you just want a distinct list of event_id values, what order they occur in should be irrelevant. If order does matter, then you should add the start_time to the SELECT list so that there is context for the order.</p>

<p>Also, these two SELECT clauses are NOT equivalent, so be careful:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT(event_id, start_time) FROM ...

SELECT DISTINCT event_id, start_time FROM ...
</code></pre>

<p>The second is the form you want.  The first will return a series of records with the data represented as a ROW construct (a single column with a tuple inside).  The second will return normal columns of data output.  It only works as expected in the single-column case where the ROW construct is reduced down since it is only a single column.</p>

12693089,"PG::Error: SELECT DISTINCT, ORDER BY expressions must appear in select list",69453043,"<h3>Syntactic vs logical order of operations</h3>
<p>I think that the confusion around the <a href=""https://blog.jooq.org/how-sql-distinct-and-order-by-are-related/"" rel=""noreferrer"">relationship between <code>DISTINCT</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code></a> (or also <code>GROUP BY</code>, for that matter), can only really be understood if the <a href=""https://blog.jooq.org/a-beginners-guide-to-the-true-order-of-sql-operations/"" rel=""noreferrer"">logical order of operations in SQL</a> is understood. It is different from the syntactic order of operations, which is the primary source of confusion.</p>
<p>In this example, it <em>looks</em> as though <code>DISTINCT</code> is related to <code>SELECT</code>, given its syntactic closeness, but it's really an operator that is applied <em>after</em> <code>SELECT</code> (the projection). Due to the nature of what <code>DISTINCT</code> does (remove duplicate rows), all the not-projected contents of a row are no longer available <em>after</em> the <code>DISTINCT</code> operation, which includes the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause. According to the <a href=""https://blog.jooq.org/a-beginners-guide-to-the-true-order-of-sql-operations/"" rel=""noreferrer"">logical order of operations (simplified)</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FROM</code> (produces all possible column references)</li>
<li><code>WHERE</code> (can use all column references from <code>FROM</code>)</li>
<li><code>SELECT</code> (can use all column references from <code>FROM</code>, and create new expressions, and alias them)</li>
<li><code>DISTINCT</code> (operates on the tuple projected by <code>SELECT</code>)</li>
<li><code>ORDER BY</code> (depending on the presence of <code>DISTINCT</code>, can operate on the tuple projected by <code>SELECT</code>, and if <code>DISTINCT</code> is absent *perhaps (depending on the dialect) also on other expressions)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What about <code>DISTINCT</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code></h3>
<p>The fact that, without <code>DISTINCT</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code> can access (in some dialects) also things that haven't been projected may be a bit weird, certainly useful. E.g. this works:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>WITH emp (id, fname, name) AS (
  VALUES (1, 'A', 'A'),
         (2, 'C', 'A'),
         (3, 'B', 'B')
)
SELECT id
FROM emp
ORDER BY fname DESC
</code></pre>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>id
--
2
3
1
</code></pre>
<p>This changes when you add <code>DISTINCT</code>. This no longer works:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>WITH emp (id, fname, name) AS (
  VALUES (1, 'A', 'A'),
         (2, 'C', 'A'),
         (3, 'B', 'B')
)
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM emp
ORDER BY fname DESC
</code></pre>
<p><a href=""https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_13&amp;fiddle=c86117c5098766af735ce4dc250ba628"" rel=""noreferrer"">dbfiddle here</a>. The error being:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ERROR:  for SELECT DISTINCT, ORDER BY expressions must appear in select list
LINE 8: ORDER BY fname DESC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because what <code>fname</code> value would you attribute to <code>name = A</code>? <code>A</code> or <code>C</code>? The answer would decide whether you'd be getting <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> as a result or <code>B</code>, <code>A</code>. It cannot be decided.</p>
<h3>PostgreSQL <code>DISTINCT ON</code></h3>
<p>Now, as mentioned in the <a href=""https://blog.jooq.org/how-sql-distinct-and-order-by-are-related/"" rel=""noreferrer"">above linked article</a>, PostgreSQL supports an exception to this, which can occasionally be useful: <code>DISTINCT ON</code> (see also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/9795660/521799"">questions like these</a>):</p>
<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>WITH emp (id, fname, name) AS (
  VALUES (1, 'A', 'A'),
         (2, 'C', 'A'),
         (3, 'B', 'B')
)
SELECT DISTINCT ON (name) id, fname, name
FROM emp
ORDER BY name, fname, id
</code></pre>

---|-----|----
1  |A    |A   
3  |B    |B   

</code></pre>
<p>This query allows to produce only distinct values of <code>name</code>, and then per duplicate row, take the first one given the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause, which makes the choice per distinct group unambiguous. <a href=""https://blog.jooq.org/using-distinct-on-in-non-postgresql-databases/"" rel=""noreferrer"">This can be emulated in other RDBMS using window functions</a>.</p>

49566059,Service Worker registration error: Unsupported MIME type (&#39;text/html&#39;),49566060,"<p>In my Express server application, I have one wildcard (asterisk / *) route that redirects to <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// Load React App
// Serve HTML file for production
if (env.name === ""production"") {
  app.get(""*"", function response(req, res) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, ""public"", ""index.html""));
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very common design pattern. However, it means that any requests for unknown text files initially get redirected to <code>index.html</code>, and therefore return with the MIME type of <code>""text/html""</code>, even if it's actually a JavaScript or SVG or some other kind of plaintext file.</p>

<p>The solution I found was to add a specific route for <code>service-worker.js</code> <em>before</em> the wildcard route:</p>

<pre><code>app.get(""/service-worker.js"", (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, ""public"", ""service-worker.js""));
});
app.get(""*"", function response(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, ""public"", ""index.html""));
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when the browser looks for <code>service-worker.js</code>, Express will return it with the correct MIME type.</p>

<p>(Note that if you try adding the <code>service-worker.js</code> route after the wildcard, it won't work because the wildcard route will override.)</p>

Then the registration function has no idea of what to do with a index.html file and tells you that the MIME-type is not correct.</p>
<p>A quick fix would be to copy the service-worker.js file to the <code>public</code> folder so that when you hit <code>http://localhost:3000/service-worker.js</code> you see the file in the browser.</p>

28708705,PyPI 400 upload error,77200627,"<p>I had a similar question but for binary packages. A fix for binary packages is to append a build tag to the version number, e.g. rename <code>mypkg-1.2.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl</code> to <code>mypkg-1.2.3-1-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl</code>.

<blockquote>
<p>build tag:
Optional build number. Must start with a digit. Acts as a tie-breaker if two wheel file names are the same in all other respects (i.e. name, version, and other tags). Sort as an empty tuple if unspecified, else sort as a two-item tuple with the first item being the initial digits as an int, and the second item being the remainder of the tag as a str.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is better than appending <code>.post1</code> as mentioned in another comment, since that is considered a different version number by <code>pip</code> so users must change their <code>requirements.txt</code> etc., which was not acceptable for me. Appending <code>-1</code>, however, is considered by <code>pip</code> to be the same version.</p>
<p>This solution probably does not work with source distributions since they don't have a &quot;build&quot; like binaries do. So this might not exactly answer the OP, but since this SO question came up a lot while searching for an answer for binaries, I thought it was worth posting here.</p>

Keep in mind that a type assertion is a way to tell typescript &quot;i know more than you do, so don't check my work&quot;. If you assert that it's an AxiosError, but it could actually be something else, typescript cannot point out that mistake to you.</p>

25798704,&quot;Please correct the error below&quot; in the Django admin when using custom user models,65044367,"<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>I had a similar problem.
But that's pretty easy to solve.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How to solve it step by step?</h2>
<p>First of all we need to talk about <strong>overriding</strong>, as you said before.
Django by default uses username field in models. And you need to change it like this in your <strong>models.py</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
</code></pre>
<p>If you still really want to override a lot of code, next: create managers. Something about this: <a href=""https://testdriven.io/blog/django-custom-user-model/"" rel=""noreferrer"">django managers</a>
In your custom manages class you need to override user creation (create_user method) and create_superuser method With this samples:</p>
<pre><code>def create_user(self, email, password, **extra_fields):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Create and save a User with the given email and password.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    log.debug(f'Creating user: {email}')
    if not email:
        raise ValueError(_('The email must be set'))
    email = self.normalize_email(email)
    user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
    user.set_password(password)
    user.save()
    log.info('Created user %s', repr(user))
</code></pre>
<p>Only after all this steps you can take care about overriding existing <strong>forms</strong>.
Django doc about this: <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/customizing/#custom-users-admin-full-example"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/customizing/#custom-users-admin-full-example</a>
implementation:</p>
<p>class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):</p>
<pre><code>    class Meta(UserCreationForm):
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ('email', )


class CustomUserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ('email', )
</code></pre>

And only now you can add code in your admin.py and change your UserAdmin like that:</p>

    form = CustomUserChangeForm

        }),
        ('Important dates', {'fields': ('last_login',)}),
    )
    # add_fieldsets is not a standard ModelAdmin attribute. UserAdmin
    # overrides get_fieldsets to use this attribute when creating a user.
    add_fieldsets = (
        (None, {
            'classes': ('wide',),
            'fields': ('email', 'password1', 'password2', 'is_admin', 'is_root', )}

    )
    list_display = ('email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'is_admin', 'created_at', 'updated_at',)
    list_filter = ('is_admin',)
    search_fields = ('email', 'first_name', 'last_name',)
    ordering = ('email',)
    filter_horizontal = ()
</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to add <strong>add_fieldsets</strong> and to override <strong>ordering</strong> by email.
In add_fieldsets you need to 2 type of passwords. If there be only 1 - error occures. From your screen by the way.</p>

25798704,&quot;Please correct the error below&quot; in the Django admin when using custom user models,25834514,"<p>Ok guys, thanks for your answers but my problem actually came from my <code>UserAdmin</code> override. </p>

<p>More specifically, <code>UserAdmin</code> uses <code>add_form</code> and <code>form</code> to refer to the creation and change forms respectively. As I named my variables <code>creation_form</code> and <code>change_form</code>, it did not override the <code>django.contrib.auth.models.User</code> forms and that's why some fields did not validate because my <code>ModelForm</code>s were not displaying those <code>User</code> fields.</p>

<p>Now I have renamed <code>creation_form</code> to <code>add_form</code> and <code>change_form</code> to <code>form</code> inside my custom <code>UserAdmin</code> and it works like a charm :-)</p>

40900414,"Dependency Injection error: Unable to resolve service for type while attempting to activate, while class is registered",40900520,"<p>To break down the error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unable to resolve service for type 'WebApplication1.Data.BloggerRepository' while attempting to activate 'WebApplication1.Controllers.BlogController'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is saying that your application is trying to create an instance of <code>BlogController</code> but it doesn't know <em>how</em> to create an instance of <code>BloggerRepository</code> to pass into the constructor.</p>
<p>Now look at your startup:</p>
<pre><code>services.AddScoped&lt;IBloggerRepository, BloggerRepository&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p>That is saying whenever a <code>IBloggerRepository</code> is required, create a <code>BloggerRepository</code> and pass that in.</p>
<p>However, your controller class is asking for the concrete class <code>BloggerRepository</code> and the dependency injection container doesn't know what to do when asked for that directly.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you just made a typo, but a fairly common one. So the simple fix is to change your controller to accept something that the DI container <em>does</em> know how to process, in this case, the interface:</p>
<pre><code>public BlogController(IBloggerRepository repository)
//                    ^
//                    Add this!
{
    _repository = repository;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that some objects have their own custom ways to be registered, this is more common when you use external Nuget packages, so it pays to read the documentation for them. For example if you got a message saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unable to resolve service for type 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IHttpContextAccessor' ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you would fix that using the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.httpservicecollectionextensions.addhttpcontextaccessor?view=aspnetcore-5.0"" rel=""noreferrer"">custom extension method</a> provided by that library which would be:</p>
<pre><code>services.AddHttpContextAccessor();

<p>Unfortunately, it's Unix/Linux-centric in that the executables generated are named just by the first part of the file name. So, if you're compiling <code>test.cpp</code>, the executable will just be called <code>test</code>, with no extension. On Windows, however, executables need to have the <code>.exe</code> extension (generally speaking, there are exceptions) to run properly. We'll take care of this by modifying the build system.</p>
<p>In Sublime, select <strong><code>Tools → Build System → New Build System…</code></strong> all the way at the bottom. A template that looks like this will come up:</p>
<pre class=""lang-json prettyprint-override""><code>{

<ul>
<li>Regular Install: <code>C:\Users\<b><i>YourUserName</i></b>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages</code> or <code>C:\Users\<b><i>YourUserName</i></b>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\Packages</code></li>
<li>Portable Install: <code><b><i>InstallationFolder</i></b>\Sublime Text 3\Data\Packages</code> <code><b><i>InstallationFolder</i></b>\Sublime Text\Data\Packages</code></li>

<p>The exact path depends on version and whether or not you upgraded from Sublime Text 3. Name the file something like <code>C++ Single File (Windows).sublime-build</code>. It should now show up in the build system selection menu and in the Command Palette.</p>
<p>Now, you should be able to compile properly (assuming proper code) and run the executable without issues.

<pre><code>trigger_error(""Error message here"", E_USER_ERROR);
</code></pre>

<p>By default, this will go in the server's error log file. See the <a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#errorlog"" rel=""noreferrer"">ErrorLog directive</a> for Apache. To set your own log file:</p>

<pre><code>ini_set('error_log', 'path/to/log/file');
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the log file you choose must already exist and be writable by the server process. The simplest way to make the file writable is to make the server user the owner of the file. (The server user may be nobody, _www, apache, or something else, depending on your OS distribution.)</p>

<p>To e-mail the error, you need to set up a custom error handler:</p>

<pre><code>function mail_error($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline) {
  $message = ""[Error $errno] $errstr - Error on line $errline in file $errfile"";
  error_log($message); // writes the error to the log file
  mail('you@yourdomain.com', 'I have an error', $message);
}
set_error_handler('mail_error', E_ALL^E_NOTICE);
</code></pre>

<p>Please see the <a href=""http://us.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">relevant PHP documentation</a> for more info.</p>

57422458,error TS6059: File is not under &#39;rootDir&#39; .. &#39;rootDir&#39; is expected to contain all source files,57429111,"<h3>What is <code>rootDir</code>?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>rootDir</code></a> is set to a root folder, that contains <em>all</em> your source files. If not specified, TS will automatically choose a suitable parent folder of all inputs. <code>rootDir</code> also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/57434522/5669456"">determines the output directory</a>.</p>
<h3>What does the error mean?</h3>
<p>My guess is you have an <code>import</code> statement for <code>logging.ts</code> somewhere in <code>notifier-server</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import {logger} from &quot;@teros-cli/logging&quot; // or similar
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>logging.ts</code> module will be <a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#why-does-a-module-in-the-exclude-list-still-get-picked-up-by-the-compiler"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>automatically</em> included</a> by the compiler, regardless of <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> options in <code>tsconfig.json</code>. One way to check all included files is <code>tsc --listFiles</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>tsconfig.json</code> file outside <code>notifier-server</code> doesn't help here. The compiler picks up exactly one config per <code>tsc</code> compilation and optionally pulls <a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html#configuration-inheritance-with-extends"" rel=""noreferrer"">inherited configs</a>. If it cannot find one in <code>notifier-server</code> project root (where you started <code>tsc</code>), only then the compiler <a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html#using-tsconfigjson"" rel=""noreferrer"">searches upwards the parent directory chain</a>, until a config is found.</p>
<h3>Possible solutions</h3>
<p>One fix is to just remove <code>&quot;rootDir&quot;: &quot;src&quot;</code> from compiler options, so it gets set automatically. Caution: <code>rootDir</code> will then consider both projects as inputs!</p>
<p>Alternative: You can add a separate <code>logging.ts</code> module contained in <code>notifier-server/src</code> project and drop the external <code>import</code>.</p>
<p>Hope, that helps!</p>

63088159,Nodejs Firebase Transaction - Update a node and send error if a condition fails,63090671,"<p>There are several key aspects to adapt in your Cloud Function:</p>
<ol>
<li>As explained in the Cloud Functions <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/terminate-functions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doc</a>, you need to manage the asynchronous Firebase operations <strong>by using promises</strong>. In your code, you use the callback &quot;version&quot; of the <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database.Reference#transaction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Transaction</code></a>. You should use the &quot;promise&quot; version, as shown below.</li>
<li>In the transaction, you need to return the new desired state you would like to write to the database node. In a previous version of your question you were returning the object you intended to send back to the Cloud Function caller: this is not correct.</li>
<li>You need to send data back to the client (i.e. the caller) when the promise returned by the transaction is resolved, as shown below (i.e. in <code>.then(r =&gt; {..})</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, to answer to your question at the bottom of your answer (&quot;how can i send back a response when a condition fails?&quot;). Just do <code>return;</code> as explained in the doc &quot;if undefined is returned (i.e. you return with no arguments) the transaction will be aborted and the data at this location will not be modified&quot;.</p>
<p>So, based on the above, you could think that the following should work. However, you will rapidly see that the <code>if (t === null)</code> test does not work. This is because the first invocation of a transaction handler may return a <code>null</code> value, see the <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/save-data#transaction-function-is-called-multiple-times"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a>, as well as the following posts: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16359496/firebase-transaction-api-call-current-data-is-null"">Firebase transaction api call current data is null</a> and <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/firebase-talk/Lyb0KlPdQEo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/firebase-talk/Lyb0KlPdQEo</a>.</p>

        .transaction(t =&gt; {

            if (t === null) {  // DOES NOT WORK...
                return;
            } else {
                // your &quot;complex&quot; logic

</code></pre>
<p>You will find a workaround in the SO post I referred above (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16359496/firebase-transaction-api-call-current-data-is-null"">Firebase transaction api call current data is null</a>). I've never tested it, I'm interested by knowing how it worked for you, since this answer got a lot of votes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another, more radical, workaround would be to use Firestore, instead of the Realtime Database. With Firestore <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/transactions?authuser=0#transactions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Transactions</a>, you can very well check in a document exists or not.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE Following the comments:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to send back different responses to the Cloud Function caller, depending on what was checked in the transaction, use a variable as shown with the dummy following example.</p>
<p>Do not re-execute the checks outside of the transaction (i.e. in the <code>then()</code>): Only in the transaction you can be sure that if another client writes to the database node before your new value is successfully written, the update function (i.e. <code>t</code>) will be called again with the new current value, and the write will be retried.</p>
<pre><code>// ...
let result = &quot;updated&quot;;
return gameIDRef
    .transaction(t =&gt; {
        console.log(t);
        if (t !== null &amp;&amp; t.max_players &gt; 20) {
            result = &quot;not updated because t.max_players &gt; 20&quot;

<p>You might not need to setup port proxy with the command from original solution if you use this setting in your attach configuration as mentioned by some people:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;host&quot;: &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;

<h2><strong>Original solution</strong></h2>

<p>Resolved on my own by redirecting port <code>6000</code> from IPv6 loopback to IPv4 loopback.</p>

"

In my opinion, it would be a better approach to find out which package is causing the error and then fix it.</p>
<h3>The quick solution</h3>
<p>In the line after <code>npm ERR! code 1</code>, you should be able to see <code>npm ERR! path...</code>. In my case the path indicates that there is a problem with the <code>node-sass</code> npm package:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>npm ERR! code 1
npm ERR! path /home/gignu/GitHub/Movie-Subtitles/node_modules/node-sass

<p>Now remove this npm package from <code>package.json</code> and see if the installation works. If it works you've found the culprit! In my case, all I had to do to fix it was to upgrade <code>node-sass</code> to the latest version.</p>
<pre><code>// package.json with the outdated dependency

&quot;node-sass&quot;: &quot;^4.14.1&quot;,
</code></pre>
<pre><code>// package.json with the updated dependency

&quot;node-sass&quot;: &quot;^7.0.1&quot;,
</code></pre>
<h3>The slow solution</h3>
<p>If the previous solution doesn't work for you I would go with @Andrew Fair's solution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took out the entire dependencies portion in my package.json file and just started working my way through installing one at a time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To do this, simply copy the whole <code>dependencies</code> section and <code>devDependencies</code> section from <code>package.json</code> and paste it into a text editor as a backup. Then delete all your dependencies and try adding back one dependency at a time. You can also add back several dependencies at a time if you have a lot of them. Each time, run <code>npm i</code> and see if it throws an error. Once you've found out which dependency is causing the error, try to upgrade that dependency to a newer version and then run <code>npm i --force</code>!</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try replacing the bad npm package with another one or look on their GitHub repository for solutions.</p>

<p>To put things in perspective, what you're doing in your entry point script is actually being executed in the <code>sh</code> shell. The commands you want to run should be executed inside a <code>mysql</code> shell.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Your entrypoint should have the following command instead to run the <code>mysql</code> commands:</p>

<pre><code>mysql -u root -p [root-password] -e ""update user set authentication_string=password(''), plugin='mysql_native_password' where user='root';""

<pre><code>mysql -u root -p [root-password] mysql -e ""update user set authentication_string=password(''), plugin='mysql_native_password' where user='root';""

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>In this command, first you enter in mysql shell using <code>mysql -u -p</code> command and then you execute the sql command using <code>-e</code> flag(it stands for execute).

19917401,Error: request entity too large,19965089,"<p>I had the same error recently, and all the solutions I tried did not work.</p>
<p>After some digging, I found that setting <code>app.use(express.bodyParser({limit: '50mb'}));</code> <strong>did</strong> set the limit correctly.</p>
<p>When adding a <code>console.log('Limit file size: ' + limit);</code> in <code>node_modules/express/node_modules/connect/lib/middleware/json.js:46</code> and restarting node, I get this output in the console:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Limit file size: 1048576
connect.multipart() will be removed in connect 3.0
visit https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/wiki/Connect-3.0 for alternatives
connect.limit() will be removed in connect 3.0
Limit file size: 52428800
Express server listening on port 3002
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that at first, when loading the <code>connect</code> module, the limit is set to 1mb (1048576 bytes). Then when I set the limit, the <code>console.log</code> is called again and this time the limit is 52428800 (50mb). However, I still get a <code>413 Request entity too large</code>.</p>
<p>Then I added <code>console.log('Limit file size: '+limit);</code> in  <code>node_modules/express/node_modules/connect/node_modules/raw-body/index.js:10</code> and saw another line in the console when calling the route with a big request (before the error output) :</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Limit file size: 1048576
</code></pre>
<p>This means that somehow, somewhere, <code>connect</code> resets the limit parameter and ignores what I specified. I tried specifying the <code>bodyParser</code> parameters in the route definition individually, but no luck either.</p>
<p>While I did not find any proper way to set it permanently, you can &quot;<em>patch</em>&quot; it in the module directly. If you are using Express 3.4.4, add this at line 46 of <code>node_modules/express/node_modules/connect/lib/middleware/json.js</code> :</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>limit = 52428800; // for 50mb, this corresponds to the size in bytes
</code></pre>
<p>The line number might differ if you don't run the same version of Express.
Please note that this is <strong>bad practice</strong> and it will be <strong>overwritten</strong> if you update your module.</p>
<p>So this temporary solution works for now, but as soon as a solution is found (or the module fixed, in case it's a module problem) you should update your code accordingly.</p>
<p>I have opened <a href=""https://github.com/visionmedia/express/issues/1815"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an issue on their GitHub</a> about this problem.</p>
<p><strong>[edit - found the solution]</strong></p>
<p>After some research and testing, I found that when debugging, I added <code>app.use(express.bodyParser({limit: '50mb'}));</code>, but <strong>after</strong> <code>app.use(express.json());</code>. Express would then set the global limit to 1mb because the first parser he encountered when running the script was <code>express.json()</code>. Moving <code>bodyParser</code> above it did the trick.</p>
<p>That said, the <code>bodyParser()</code> method will be deprecated in Connect 3.0 and should not be used. Instead, you should declare your parsers explicitly, like so :</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>app.use(express.json({limit: '50mb'}));
app.use(express.urlencoded({limit: '50mb'}));
</code></pre>
<p>In case you need multipart (for file uploads) see <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/express-js/iP2VyhkypHo/5AXQiYN3RPcJ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[second edit]</strong></p>
<p>Note that in Express 4, instead of <code>express.json()</code> and <code>express.urlencoded()</code>, you must require the <a href=""https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">body-parser</a> module and use its <code>json()</code> and <code>urlencoded()</code> methods, like so:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.json({limit: '50mb'}));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({limit: '50mb', extended: true}));
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>extended</code> option is not explicitly defined for <code>bodyParser.urlencoded()</code>, it will throw a warning (<code>body-parser deprecated undefined extended: provide extended option</code>). This is because this option will be required in the next version and will <strong>not</strong> be optional anymore. For more info on the <code>extended</code> option, you can refer to the <a href=""https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#extended"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">readme</a> of <code>body-parser</code>.</p>
<p><strong>[third edit]</strong></p>
<p>It seems that in Express v4.16.0 onwards, we can go back to the initial way of doing this (thanks to @GBMan for the tip):</p>
<pre><code>app.use(express.json({limit: '50mb'}));
app.use(express.urlencoded({limit: '50mb'}));
</code></pre>

70345643,&quot;Failed to get document because the client is offline&quot; Firebase error with the firestore emulator,70362119,"<blockquote>
<p>The Failed to get document because the client is offline</p>
</blockquote>
<p>error occurs when you attempt to retrieve a single document, you are offline, and the requested document is absent from the local cache. In this case, the client has no information about the document and does not know if it exists on the backend. There is no way to know if the document exists until a network connection is re-established. So to avoid incorrectly reporting that a document does not exist, this error is produced.</p>
<p>This situation can largely be avoided by getting the document while in an online state so that it is present in the local cache. Note, however, that the local cache is a cache, and &quot;stale&quot; entries may be evicted from the cache to make room for other data. If the data in the document does not change frequently, you could also instead register a snapshot listener via <code>addSnapshotListener()</code> and keep the listener alive to ensure that the document remains in the local cache.
Also, there can be multiple other reasons for this error, some them are :</p>
<ol>
<li>You tried to reference the collection/ document which was not yet created. So, just create a collection with a dummy doc or just wait for the document to be created and see if it works fine. <br></li>
<li>Implement try ... catch around all get().await() calls. Unhandled exceptions can lead to this error <br></li>
<li>Issue was fixed by changing the port number of the emulator. Try for 8081 if 8080 is not working,</li>

Curl and even ssl.wrap_socket over socket may still work with the same exact parameters but tornado.httpclient.HTTPRequest does not.

51948745,Error: Unable to establish IPMI v2 / RMCP+ session,64297080,"<p>(SOLVED for a Dell machine)</p>
<p>I had exactly the same issue on a <strong>Dell Poweredge R430</strong> machine <strong>after having changed the system motherboard</strong>:
although my credentials were restored in the new IDRAC board from the chassis flash backup, and despite the fact my credentials still allowed me to enter the IDRAC Web Interface, I was not able anymore to interact with the IDRAC board through IPMIv2/lanplus/SOL interface, facing the same problem of <code>Error: Unable to establish IPMI v2 / RMCP+ session</code>.</p>
<p>For me the solution was, as suggested by Rupeshrams herein <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/55615668/13646401"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/55615668/13646401</a>, to &quot;reset ipmi default password to the <strong>same</strong> old one&quot; (&quot;same&quot; because I had system tools all hardcoded with old credentials) with the IDRAC <strong>Web Interface</strong> as this :
In your browser, enter the (static) ip address of the IDRAC : this should open an https web site.
Then :</p>
<pre><code>Menu Overview -&gt; IDRAC SETTINGS -&gt; User Authentication
-&gt; Click on the userID of your admin account -&gt; Next
-&gt; check &quot;change your password&quot; checkbox and enter the same (or new) password
-&gt; Apply
</code></pre>
<p>Why : I understood that passwords were <strong>hashed/encrypted</strong> in my previous motherboard <strong>with a key specific to that old motherboard</strong>. By Changing the motherboard, and restoring a user database hashed by a from-now-on unknown key, my credentials became invalid, at least for using ipmitool and IPMIv2 interface. What was confusing me, but that finally helped me to solve the problem, was the fact that old credentials were still valid to enter the IDRAC web interface.</p>
<p>TIP: every advice to check for IPMIv2/UDP 623 service availability with nmap or to &quot;activate SOL (Serial Over Lan)&quot; are helpful: &quot;SOL activate&quot; can be easily performed on the IDRAC web interface:</p>
<pre><code>Menu Overview -&gt; IDRAC SETTINGS -&gt; Network -&gt; SerialOverLAN
</code></pre>
<p>Every advice to &quot;unlock&quot; credentials through <strong>ipmitool</strong> various commands just can not and must not work.
But, if web interface is not accessible, then you need to access the IDRAC through everything you can except ipmitools, at least in the case of a Dell machine (at first try BIOS &quot;/IDRAC Settings/User configuration&quot;, or ssh, telnet, or anything else such as RACADM, or even the real serial interface with a db9 cable and a tty terminal (eg a PC with hyperterminal or anyother soft tty emulator).</p>

<pre><code>ps -ef | grep bar | { grep -v grep || true; }

<p>Or even:</p>

<pre><code>ps -ef | grep bar | grep -v grep | cat
</code></pre>
"
6550484,Prevent grep returning an error when input doesn&#39;t match,49627999,"<h3>Short answer</h3>
<p>Write</p>
<pre><code>ps -ef | grep bar | { grep -v grep || test $? = 1; }
</code></pre>
<p>if you are using <strong><code>set -e</code></strong>.</p>
<p>If you use bash's <strong><code>pipefail</code></strong> option (<code>set -o pipefail</code>), remember to apply the exception handling (<code>||test</code>) to every <code>grep</code> in the pipeline:</p>
<pre><code>ps -ef | { grep bar || test $? = 1; } | { grep -v grep || test $? = 1; }
</code></pre>
<p>In <strong>shell scripts</strong> I suggest you to use the <em>”catch-1-grep“</em> (c1grep) utility function:</p>
<pre><code>c1grep() { grep &quot;$@&quot; || test $? = 1; }
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>Explained</h3>
<p><code>grep</code>'s exit status is either 0, 1 or 2: [1]</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> means a line is selected</li>
<li><code>1</code> means no lines were selected</li>
<li><code>2</code> means an error occurred</li>
</ul>
<p><code>grep</code> can also return other codes if it's interrupted by a signal (e.g. <code>130</code> for SIGINT).</p>
<p>Since we only want to ignore exit status <code>1</code>, we use <code>test</code> to suppress that specific exit status.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>grep</code> returns <code>0</code>, <code>test</code> is not run.</li>
<li>If <code>grep</code> returns <code>1</code>, <code>test</code> is run and returns <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>grep</code> returns any other value, <code>test</code> is run and returns <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last case, the script will exit immediately due to <code>set -e</code> or <code>set -o pipefail</code>. However, if you don't care about <code>grep</code> errors at all, you can of course write</p>
<pre><code>ps -ef | grep bar | { grep -v grep || true; }
</code></pre>
<p>as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6550484/prevent-grep-returning-an-error-when-input-doesnt-match#6550543"">Sean</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>[additional] usage in shell scripts</h3>
<p>In shell scripts, if you are using <code>grep</code> a lot, I suggest you to define an utility function:</p>
<pre><code># &quot;catch exit status 1&quot; grep wrapper
c1grep() { grep &quot;$@&quot; || test $? = 1; }
</code></pre>
<p>This way your pipe will get short &amp; simple again, without losing the features of <code>set -e</code> and <code>set -o pipefail</code>:</p>
<pre><code>ps -ef | c1grep bar | c1grep -v grep
</code></pre>
<p>FYI:</p>
<ul>
<li>I called it <code>c1grep</code> to emphasize it's simply catching exit status <code>1</code>, nothing else.</li>
<li>I could have called the function <code>grep</code> instead (<code>grep() { env grep &quot;$@&quot; ...; }</code>), but I prefer a less confusing and more explicit name, <code>c1grep</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>[additional] <code>ps</code> + <code>grep</code></h3>
<p>So if you want to know how to avoid <code>grep -v grep</code> or even the <code>| grep</code> part of <code>ps|grep</code> at all, take a look at some of the other answers; but this is somewhat off-topic imho.</p>
<hr />
<p>[1] <code>grep</code> documentation (<a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html#tag_20_55_14"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">POSIX spec</a>, <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Exit-Status"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GNU grep docs</a>, <a href=""https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=grep&amp;sektion=1#EXIT_STATUS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FreeBSD manpage</a>)</p>
"
6550484,Prevent grep returning an error when input doesn&#39;t match,6550906,"<p>A good trick to avoid <code>grep -v grep</code> is this:</p>

<pre><code>ps -ef | grep '[b]ar'
</code></pre>

<p>That regular expression only matches the string ""bar"". However in the <code>ps</code> output, the string ""bar"" does not appear with the grep process.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the days before I learned about <code>pgrep</code>, I wrote this function to automate the above command:</p>

<pre><code>psg () { 
    local -a patterns=()
    (( $# == 0 )) &amp;&amp; set -- $USER
    for arg do
        patterns+=(""-e"" ""[${arg:0:1}]${arg:1}"")

"
35445190,Strange MySQL &quot;read-only&quot; error,35502174,"<p>As I see it there are two broad reasons for why your database is being set to read only:</p>

<h2>1) MySQL is setting itself read only</h2>

<p>I'm not sure what might cause MySQL to go read only, perhaps disk issues or corruption of database? In any case I'd expect something to appear in the logs, so check the MySQL (and system) logs.</p>

<h2>2) A client is setting the database read only</h2>

<p>Clients connecting to MySQL can set the database read only using the command:</p>

<pre><code>SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;
</code></pre>

<p>however to do this the user is required to have <code>SUPER</code> privileges. This permission shouldn't be needed for websites, applications, etc that are using MySQL - keep it only for an admin account that you use for administering the database.</p>

<p>Lock down the permissions that each user has so they only have permission to do the things that they need on the databases / tables that are applicable. If you're using some out-of-the-box applications they should come with instructions detailing what permissions are required (e.g. <code>SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE</code>).</p>
"
35445190,Strange MySQL &quot;read-only&quot; error,35471740,"<p>Based on my question's comments (special thanks to @Eborbob) and my update, I have figured that some process in the system resets the <code>read-only</code> flag to <code>ON (1)</code>, which seem to trigger the issue and results in the website becoming inaccessible. In order to fix the problem as well as make this fix <em>persistent</em> across software and server restarts, I decided to update MySQL configuration file <code>my.cnf</code> and restart the DB server.</p>

<p>After making the relevant update (in my case, addition) to the configuration file</p>

<pre><code>read_only=0
</code></pre>

<p>let's verify that the flag is indeed set to <code>OFF (0)</code>:</p>

<pre><code># mysql

"
10043841,C - error: ignoring return value of scanf?,53711801,"<p><code>scanf</code> returns the number of ""items"", i.e. values passed both in the format string (a single item is e.g. <code>%d</code>, <code>%c</code> and so on), and in the subsequent arguments to <code>scanf</code>, for example, to read two integers separated by comma and space, you would use:</p>

<pre><code>int x, y;
int items = scanf(""%d, %d"", &amp;x, &amp;y);
assert(items == 2);
</code></pre>

<p>I've already spoiled what my suggestion will be above - instead of adding unused variables, if you just want to read it, add an assertion:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
/* ... */
assert(scanf(""%d"", &amp;sides) &gt; 0);
/* ... */
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>assert(scanf(""%d"", &amp;sides));</code> is not enough, because of EOF (this will return <code>-1</code>). It would be really elegant.</p>

<p>I think this is the way to go, if you don't want to continue your program with an uninitialized variable (<code>sides</code>) in this case.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can capture <code>scanf</code>'s result to a variable, and handle it gracefully like in the other answers.</p>

If-Modified-Since
If-None-Match

<p>These headers contain 'preconditions', allowing the client to tell the server to only complete the request if certain conditions are met.

<p>The response status code <code>412</code> (Precondition Failed) is typically used when these preconditions fail. </p>

<p>- take ownership of the problem file(s) with <code>chown</code>.</p>
<p>- clone the problem file(s), delete the original(s), and replace them.</p>

<p>You need to have Qt5 installed in the system, and you need to have its <code>qmake</code> in <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>Note that if you choose to use the installer, it will require you to log in to or create a qt.io account to perform the installation.</p>

<p>After the installation, find where <code>qmake</code> is located. For me using the installer for 5.14.2 it was in <code>/Users/Admin/Qt5.14.2/5.14.2/clang_64/bin</code>. You need to add this to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. To do so edit <code>.bash_profile</code> in your home folder (may need to press <kbd>Command + Shift + .</kbd> first to see dotfiles in Finder) and add to it something the following:</p>

Essentially some components in Visual Studio 2012 were signed with a SHA256 hash certificate not installed on all Windows versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Are you on a virtual?</strong></em> It might not be updated - <em><strong>running Windows Update might fix the whole problem?</strong></em> You need a <strong><code>root certificate update</code></strong>. I would try that before reading the information below. I would assume the problem would be fixed by now via Windows Update, but perhaps not?</p>

<p>When you run the <code>docker build</code> command, the Docker client gathers all files that need to be sent to the Docker daemon, so it can build the image. This 'package' of files is called the <strong>context</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What files and directories are added to the context?</strong><br />
The context contains all files and subdirectories in the directory that you pass to the <code>docker build</code> command. For example, when you call <code>docker build img:tag dir_to_build</code>, the context will be everything inside <code>dir_to_build</code>.</p>
<p>If the Docker client does not have <strong>sufficient permissions</strong> to read some of the files in the context, you get the <code>error checking context: 'can't stat ' &lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> error.</p>
<p>There are two solutions to this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move your Dockerfile, together with the files that are needed to build your image, to a separate directory <code>separate_dir</code> that contains no other files/subdirectories. When you now call <code>docker build img:tag separate_dir</code>, the context will only contain the files that are actually required for building the image. (If the error still persists that means you need to change the permissions on your files so that the Docker client can access them).</li>
<li>Exclude files from the context using a <strong>.dockerignore</strong> file. Most of the time, this is probably what you want to be doing.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file"" rel=""noreferrer"">From the official Docker documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the docker CLI sends the context to the docker daemon, it looks for a file named <strong>.dockerignore</strong> in the root directory of the context. If this file exists, the CLI modifies the context to <strong>exclude files and directories</strong> that match patterns in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>To answer the question</h3>
<p>I would create a <code>.dockerignore</code> file in the same directory as the <code>Dockerfile</code>: <code>~/.dockerignore</code> with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code># By default, ignore everything
*
# Add exception for the directories you actually want to include in the context
!project-source-code
!project-config-dir
# source files
!*.py
!*.sh
</code></pre>

73753672,A fatal error occurred. The folder [/usr/share/dotnet/host/fxr] does not exist,73899341,"<p>When .NET (Core) was first released for Linux, it was not yet available in the official Ubuntu repo. So instead, many of us added the Microsoft APT repo in order to install it.</p>
<p>Now, the packages are part of the Ubuntu repo, and they are conflicting with the Microsoft packages. This error is a result of mixed packages.</p>
<p>So you need to pick which one you're going to use, and ensure they don't mix. Personally, I decided to stick with the Microsoft packages because I figured they'll be better kept up-to-date.</p>
<p>First, remove all existing packages to get to a clean state:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>sudo apt remove dotnet* aspnetcore* netstandard*
</code></pre>
<p>Then, create a file in <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d</code> (I named mine <code>99microsoft-dotnet.pref</code>, following the convention that files in such <code>*.d</code> directories are typically prefixed with a 2-digit number so that they sort and load in a predictable order) with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>Package: *
Pin: origin &quot;packages.microsoft.com&quot;
Pin-Priority: 1001
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the regular update &amp; install (NOTE: this will install .NET SDK 7.0; specify 6.0 instead if you prefer the LTS release):</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-7.0
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If you would rather use the official Ubuntu packages</strong>, remove all the existing packages as above, but instead of creating the <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d</code> entry, just delete the Microsoft repo:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-7.0
</code></pre>
<p>However, note that the Microsoft repo contains other packages such as PowerShell, SQL Server Command-Line Tools, etc., so removing it may not be desirable.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's possible to make the APT config more specific to just these packages, but this is working for me for now. Hopefully Microsoft and Ubuntu work together to fix this soon.</p>

<p>just mean that CMake was unable to find your C/CXX compiler to compile a simple test program (one of the first things CMake tries while detecting your build environment).</p>
<p>The steps to find your problem are dependent on the build environment you want to generate. The following tutorials are a collection of answers here on Stack Overflow and some of my own experiences with CMake on Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 and Ubuntu 14.04.</p>
<p><strong>Preconditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have installed the compiler/IDE and it was able to once compile any other program (directly without CMake)</p>
<ul>
<li>You e.g. may have the IDE, but may not have installed the compiler or supporting framework itself like described in <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42701019/problems-generating-solution-for-vs-2017-with-cmake"">Problems generating solution for VS 2017 with CMake</a></em> or <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38171878/how-do-i-tell-cmake-to-use-clang-on-windows"">How do I tell CMake to use Clang on Windows?</a></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You have the latest <a href=""https://cmake.org/download/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CMake version</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>You have access rights on the drive you want CMake to generate your build environment</p>
</li>
<li><p>You have a clean build directory (because CMake does cache things from the last try) e.g. as sub-directory of your source tree</p>
<p><strong>Windows cmd.exe</strong></p>
<pre><code>  &gt; rmdir /s /q VS2015
  &gt; mkdir VS2015
  &gt; cd VS2015
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Bash shell</strong></p>
<pre><code>  $ rm -rf MSYS
  $ mkdir MSYS
  $ cd MSYS
</code></pre>
<p>and make sure your command shell points to your newly created binary output directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General things you can/should try</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is CMake able find and run with any/your default compiler? Run without giving a generator</p>
<pre><code> &gt; cmake ..
 -- Building for: Visual Studio 14 2015
 ...
</code></pre>
<p>Perfect if it correctly determined the generator to use - like here <code>Visual Studio 14 2015</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>What was it that actually failed?</p>
<p>In the previous build output directory look at <code>CMakeFiles\CMakeError.log</code> for any error message that make sense to you or try to open/compile the test project generated at <code>CMakeFiles\[Version]\CompilerIdC</code>|<code>CompilerIdCXX</code> directly from the command line (as found in the error log).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>CMake can't find Visual Studio</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Try to select the correct <a href=""http://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#visual-studio-generators"" rel=""noreferrer"">generator version</a>:</p>
<pre><code> &gt; cmake --help
 &gt; cmake -G &quot;Visual Studio 14 2015&quot; ..
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>If that doesn't help, try to set the Visual Studio environment variables first (the path could vary):</p>
<pre><code> &gt; &quot;c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat&quot;
 &gt; cmake ..
</code></pre>
<p>or use the <code>Developer Command Prompt for VS2015</code> short-cut in your Windows Start Menu under <code>All Programs</code>/<code>Visual Studio 2015</code>/<code>Visual Studio Tools</code> (thanks at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/1887976/antwane"">@Antwane</a> for the hint).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Background</em>: CMake does support all Visual Studio releases and flavors (Express, Community, Professional, Premium, Test, Team, Enterprise, Ultimate, etc.). To determine the location of the compiler it uses a combination of searching the registry (e.g. at <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\[Version];InstallDir</code>), system environment variables and - if none of the others did come up with something - plainly try to call the compiler.</p>
<p><strong>CMake can't find GCC (MinGW/MSys)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>You start the MSys <code>bash</code> shell with <code>msys.bat</code> and just try to directly call <code>gcc</code></p>
<pre><code> $ gcc
 gcc.exe: fatal error: no input files
 compilation terminated.
</code></pre>
<p>Here it did find <code>gcc</code> and is complaining that I didn't gave it any parameters to work with.</p>
<p>So the following should work:</p>
<pre><code> $ cmake -G &quot;MSYS Makefiles&quot; ..
 -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.8.1
 ...
 $ make
</code></pre>
<p>If GCC was not found call <code>export PATH=...</code> to add your compilers path (see <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7584602/how-to-set-path-environment-variable-in-cmake-script"">How to set PATH environment variable in CMake script?</a></em>) and try again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it's still not working, try to set the <code>CXX</code> compiler path directly by exporting it (path may vary)</p>
<pre><code> $ export CC=/c/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe
 $ export CXX=/c/MinGW/bin/g++.exe
 $ cmake -G &quot;MinGW Makefiles&quot; ..
 -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.8.1
 ...
 $ mingw32-make
</code></pre>
<p>For more details see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17275348/how-to-specify-new-gcc-path-for-cmake"">How to specify new GCC path for CMake</a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When using the &quot;MinGW Makefiles&quot; generator you have to use the <code>mingw32-make</code> program distributed with MinGW</p>
</li>
<li><p>Still not working? That's weird. Please make sure that the compiler is there and it has executable rights (see also preconditions chapter above).</p>
<p>Otherwise the last resort of CMake is to not try any compiler search itself and set CMake's internal variables directly by</p>
<pre><code> $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/c/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/c/MinGW/bin/g++.exe ..
</code></pre>
<p>For more details see <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13851830/cmake-doesnt-honour-d-cmake-cxx-compiler-g"">Cmake doesn&#39;t honour -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16128199/cmake-error-setting-compiler"">Cmake error setting compiler</a></em></p>
<p>Alternatively those variables can also be set via <code>cmake-gui.exe</code> on Windows. See <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29746950/cmake-cannot-find-compiler"">Cmake cannot find compiler</a></em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Background</em>: Much the same as with Visual Studio. CMake supports all sorts of GCC flavors. It searches the environment variables (CC, CXX, etc.) or simply tries to call the compiler. In addition it will detect any prefixes (when <a href=""http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling"" rel=""noreferrer"">cross-compiling</a>) and tries to add it to all binutils of the GNU compiler toolchain (<code>ar</code>, <code>ranlib</code>, <code>strip</code>, <code>ld</code>, <code>nm</code>, <code>objdump</code>, and <code>objcopy</code>).</p>
"

55530954,How to get resolved value/rejected error in finally block?,55531429,"<p>The finally is a function used to execute code regardless of the resolution or rejection of a promise, code such as cleaning resources (closing connections, etc). So it is not a good idea to use it for a case where you need the data. Also, I don't suggest the use of global variable, since this does not follow much the idea of the Promise.</p>

<p>If you need both the value in case the Promise succeed or fails, I suggest using a sequence of <code>then</code>, <code>catch</code> and <code>then</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>var q = require('Q');

var defer = q.defer();

setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(""----------------------------------"");

    promise2 = defer.promise;
    var t = promise2.then(function (value) {
        console.log('defer then =&gt; ' + value);
        return { status: ""success"", value: value };
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        console.log('defer catch =&gt; ' + err);
        return { status: ""err"", value: err };
    })
    .then(function (dataOrError) {
        console.log('function pro1 : ' + defer);
        // console.log('defer finally(resolved value) =&gt; ' + data); // how to get 123 here
        // console.log('defer finally(error) =&gt; ' + data); // how to get 'Error occurred.' here
        doSomething(dataOrError); // Here you can check if you got an error or the value you exepected.
    })

    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log('after2: ' + t);
    },2000)

    defer.resolve('123');
    defer.reject('Error occurred.');
},10);
</code></pre>

<p>But, if you are going to execute code, depending on the result of you promise (resolved or rejected), you should use this pattern:</p>

<pre><code>promise.then((data) =&gt; {
   //doSomething with data
   return data;
 }).catch((err) =&gt; {
   //doSomithing with error
   return error;
 }).then((dataOrError) =&gt; {
  //doSomething with dataOrErro that does not depend if it is data or error
 });

"
60815037,AWS DotNet SDK Error: Unable to get IAM security credentials from EC2 Instance Metadata Service,69926857,"<p>Since AWS SDK credentials configuration is causing a lot of headache, I'll throw in some context. First of all, if you are using dotnet core, use the AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup package (<a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config-netcore.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config-netcore.html</a>), which will respect your appsettings.json.</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;AWS&quot;: {
    &quot;Region&quot;: &quot;eu-west-1&quot;,
    &quot;Profile&quot;: &quot;theprofileyouwantouse&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>csproj:</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup&quot; Version=&quot;3.7.1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;AWSSDK.SecurityToken&quot; Version=&quot;3.7.1.71&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>var config = host.Services.GetService&lt;IConfiguration&gt;();
var options = config.GetAWSOptions();
using var client = options.CreateServiceClient&lt;IAmazonSecurityTokenService&gt;();
var result = await client.GetCallerIdentityAsync(new Amazon.SecurityToken.Model.GetCallerIdentityRequest { });
</code></pre>
<p>This will try to pick up encrypted credentials in ~/AppData/Local/AWSToolkit and secondly based on your shared config file (~/.aws/config). As of november 2021, it does not utilize aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key, aws_session_token in the version 1 shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)*</p>
<p>Next, if the roles you are assuming are AWS SSO, you need the following packages in your csproj file:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;AWSSDK.SSO&quot; Version=&quot;3.7.0.94&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;AWSSDK.SSOOIDC&quot; Version=&quot;3.7.0.94&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>*If you happen to have invertedly added your credentials to your shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials) as [profile myprofile] instead of just [myprofile] the SDK will not behave as you expected, so delete that. If your credentials file is fine, then you don't have to touch it, but keep in mind that the SDK will noe use the cached credentials if any found in that file.</p>
<p>Now, the author does not use the AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup package, which means that we are getting a slightly different credentials resolving path. Most importantly: appsettings.json is not respected, this means you must specify the profile you want to use differently, for example by using the AWS_PROFILE environment variable.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are landing directly in the FallbackCredentialsFactory.cs which does this when resolving credentials:</p>
<pre><code>            CredentialsGenerators = new List&lt;CredentialsGenerator&gt;
            {
#if BCL
                () =&gt; new AppConfigAWSCredentials(),            // Test explicit keys/profile name first.
#endif
                () =&gt; AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityCredentials.FromEnvironmentVariables(),
                // Attempt to load the default profile.  It could be Basic, Session, AssumeRole, or SAML.
                () =&gt; GetAWSCredentials(credentialProfileChain),
                () =&gt; new EnvironmentVariablesAWSCredentials(), // Look for credentials set in environment vars.
                () =&gt; ECSEC2CredentialsWrapper(proxy),      // either get ECS credentials or instance profile credentials
            };

</code></pre>
<p>Now the last step in resolving credentials &quot;ECSEC2&quot; has a fallback which returns this:</p>
<p><code>DefaultInstanceProfileAWSCredentials.Instance</code></p>
<p>Which leads us to the error which the author sees.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are not using AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup, specify the profile using an ENV-variable in launch.json or launchSettings.json if you are going to use the default constructor like the author</li>
<li>Rember to add the AWS SSO packages if needed</li>

74547130,Error: $VARIABLE is not listed as a dependency in turbo.json,76105098,"<p>In NextJS, <code>process.env</code> is actually a dynamic structure that behaves differently from a traditional JavaScript object, despite having a similar interface. Because of this, NextJS can't always know whether a given key will exist on the <code>process.env</code> &quot;object&quot; at runtime. As a result, attempting to access a non-existent key using dot notation, like <code>process.env.someKey</code>, may cause a runtime error.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, a better practice is to <strong>use square bracket syntax</strong> to attempt to extract the value from <code>process.env</code>.

<p><code>fork := true</code> helps <code>sbt run</code> get rid of original harmless error in my UPDATE 1. So the <code>build.sbt</code> looks like this</p>
<pre><code>name := &quot;FindRetiredPeople&quot;
version := &quot;1.0&quot;

  &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-sql&quot; % &quot;3.3.2&quot;,

<p>Note when I <code>sbt assembly</code>, I am still using this (no <code>fork := true</code> and add <code>&quot;provided&quot;</code>):</p>
<pre><code>name := &quot;FindRetiredPeople&quot;

8978013,Error: unmappable character for encoding UTF8 during maven compilation,8979120,"<p>Configure the maven-compiler-plugin to use the same character encoding that your source files are encoded in (e.g):</p>

<p>Many maven plugins will by default use the ""project.build.sourceEncoding"" property so setting this in your pom will cover most plugins.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>However, I prefer setting the encoding in each plugin's configuration that supports it as I like to be explicit.</p>

<p>When your source code is compiled by the maven-compiler-plugin your source code files are read in by the compiler plugin using whatever encoding the compiler plugin is configured with. If your source files have a different encoding than the compiler plugin is using then it is possible that some characters may not exist in both encodings.</p>

<p>Many people prefer to set the encoding on their source files to UTF-8 so as to avoid this problem. To do this in Eclipse you can right click on a project and select Properties->Resource->Text File Encoding and change it to UTF-8. This will encode all your source files in UTF-8. (You should also explicitly configure the maven-compiler-plugin as mentioned above to use UTF-8 encoding.) With your source files and the compiler plugin both using the same encoding you shouldn't have any more unmappable characters during compilation.</p>

<p>Note, You can also set the file encoding globally in eclipse through Window->Preferences->General->Workspace->Text File Encoding. You can also set the encoding per file type through Window->Preferences->General->Content Types.</p>

8978013,Error: unmappable character for encoding UTF8 during maven compilation,16418358,"<p>I came across this problem just now and ended up resolving it like so: I opened up the offending .java file in Notepad++ and from the Encoding menu I selected ""Convert to UTF-8 without BOM"". Saved. Re-ran maven, all went through ok. </p>

<p>If the offending resource was not encoded in UTF-8 - as you have configured for your maven compiler plugin - you would see in the Encoding menu of Np++ a bullet mark next to the file's <em>current</em> encoding (in my case I saw it was set to ""Encode in ANSI"").</p>

<p>So your maven compiler plugin invoked the Java compiler with the -encoding option set to UTF-8, but the compiler encountered a ANSI-encoded source file and reported this as an error. This used to be a warning previously in Java 5 but is treated as an error in Java 6+</p>

<p>I was trying to create a Docker container for an existing repository that already had the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>.yarn/releases/yarn-3.1.1.cjs</li>
<li>.yarnrc.yml</li>
<li>.nvmrc</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>.nvmrc</strong></p>

    spec: &quot;@yarnpkg/plugin-interactive-tools&quot;

<p>So I simply followed these <a href=""https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yarn instructions</a> to install its Corepack and the latest Yarn 3.3.0 and also installed Git since it used that.</p>
<p>I renamed .yarnrc.yml to .yarnrc.yml.old so it wouldn't be used or cause conflicts.</p>
<p>Then I re-generated .yarnrc.yml and the .yarn folder so it would have Yarn 3.3.0 instead of 3.1.1 by running:</p>

<p>In your example, if the program is ""ill-formed"", the compiler is required to tell you that somehow - issue a diagnostic.</p>

<p>Compilers are free to print diagnostics whenever they want.</p>

<p>Compilers are mandated to print diagnostics in some situations.  ""Most"" ill-formed programs require a diagnostic.  What a diagnostic is exactly is implementation defined.  It has been noted that printing a single blank newline, or a space, is a valid diagnostic under the standard.</p>

<p>That would be considered a poor quality of implementation.</p>

<p>Once the diagnostic is printed when there is an ill-formed program that requires a diagnostic, the compiler is free to do anything.  It can produce an executable that somewhat matches what you ask for, produce an executable that does anything it wants, or produce no executable.</p>

<p>The standard does not differentiate between warnings and errors.</p>

<p>An ill-formed program that requires a diagnostic that print a warning, then continue to compile, does not violate the standard.</p>

<p>An ill-formed program with no diagnistic required can print a diagnostic.  It may choose to produce an executable or not.  The executable could do something reasonable or not.</p>

41430791,Python list error: [::-1] step on [:-1] slice,41430981,"<p><strong>The first <code>-1</code> in <code>a[:-1:-1]</code> doesn't mean what you think it does.</strong></p>

<p>In slicing, negative start/end indices are not interpreted literally. Instead, they are used to conveniently refer to the end of the list (i.e. they are relative to <code>len(a)</code>). This happens irrespectively of the direction of the slicing.</p>

<p>This means that</p>

<pre><code>a[:-1:-1]
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>a[:len(a)-1:-1]
</code></pre>

<p>When omitted during reverse slicing, the start index defaults to <code>len(a)-1</code>, making the above equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>a[len(a)-1:len(a)-1:-1]
</code></pre>

<p>This always gives an empty list, since the start and end indices are the same and the end index is exclusive.</p>

<p>To slice in reverse up to, and including, the zeroth element you can use any of the following notations:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a[::-1]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:None:-1]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:-len(a)-1:-1]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
</code></pre>
"
41430791,Python list error: [::-1] step on [:-1] slice,41431849,"<p>When you type <code>[1, 2, 3, ...][1:4:1]</code> it is the same as <code>[1, 2, 3, ...][slice(1, 4, 1)]</code>. So <code>1:4:1</code> is the shorthand for <code>slice</code> object. <code>slice</code> signature is <code>slice(stop)</code> or <code>slice(start, stop[, step])</code> and you can also use <code>None</code> for arguments.</p>

<pre><code>:: -&gt; slice(None, None, None)
:4 -&gt; slice(4)
# and so on
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose we have got <code>[a: b: c]</code>. <strong>Rules</strong> for indices will be as follows:  </p>

<ol>
<li>First <code>c</code> is checked. Default is <code>+1</code>, sign of <code>c</code> indicates forward or backward direction of the step. Absolute value of <code>c</code> indicates the step size.  </li>
<li>Than <code>a</code> is checked. When <code>c</code> is positive or <code>None</code>, default for <code>a</code> is <code>0</code>. When <code>c</code> is negative, default for <code>a</code> is <code>-1</code>.</li>
<li>Finally <code>b</code> is checked. When <code>c</code> is positive or <code>None</code>, default for <code>b</code> is <code>len</code>. When <code>c</code> is negative default for <code>b</code> is <code>-(len+1)</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Degenerated slices in Python are handled gracefully:  </p>

<ul>
<li>the index that is too large or too small is replaced with <code>len</code> or <code>0</code>.  </li>
<li>an upper bound smaller than the lower bound returns an empty list or string or whatever else (for positive <code>c</code>). </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Roughly speaking, Python picks up elements while this condition <code>(a  &lt;  b) if (c &gt; 0) else (a &gt; b)</code> is <code>True</code> (updating <code>a += c</code> on every step). Also, all negative indices are replaced with <code>len - index</code>.</p>

<p>If you combine this rules and notes it will make sense why you got an empty list. In your case:</p>

<pre><code> In[1]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][:-1:-1]        # `c` is negative so `a` is -1 and `b` is -1
Out[1]: [] 

# it is the same as:

 In[2]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][-1: -1: -1]    # which will produce you an empty list 
Out[2]: []

55618717,Error thrown on navigator pop until : &quot;!_debugLocked&#39;: is not true.&quot;,55622474,"<p>Instead of giving you a direct answer, I'm going to walk you through how I thought about this when I saw the question, in the hope that it'll help you in the future.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the assertion. It says <code>Failed assertion: line 1995 pos 12: '!_debugLocked': I/flutter (24830): is not true.</code>. Hmm, interesting. Let's take a look at that line of code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>assert(!_debugLocked);</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that doesn't give me much more information, let's look at the variable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>bool _debugLocked = false; // used to prevent re-entrant calls to push, pop, and friends</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's better. It's there to prevent re-entrant calls to push, pop, etc (by that it means that it doesn't want you calling 'push', 'pop', etc from within a call to 'push', 'pop'). So let's trace that back to your code.</p>

<p>This seems like the likely culprit:</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>bottomSheet.closed.then((v) {
  Navigator.of(context)
    .popUntil((r) =&gt; r.settings.isInitialRoute);
});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to skip a step here and use deductive reasoning instead - I'm betting that the closed future is finished during a <code>pop</code>. Go ahead and confirm that by reading the code if you feel like it.</p>

<p>So, if the issue is that we're calling pop from within a pop function, we need to figure out a way to defer the call to pop until after the pop has completed.</p>

<p>This becomes quite simple - there's two ways to do this. The simple way is to just use a delayed future with zero delay, which will have dart schedule the call as soon as possible once the current call stack returns to the event loop:</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>Future.delayed(Duration.zero, () {
  Navigator. ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>The other more flutter-y way of doing it would be to use the Scheduler to schedule a call for after the current build/render cycle is done:</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
  Navigator. ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>Either way should eliminate the problem you're having.</p>

<p>Another option is also possible though - in your ExtendedFloatingActionButton where you call pop:</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>ExtendedFloatingActionButton(
 text: ""ORDER DETAILS"",
  action: () {
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  },
),
</code></pre>

<p>you could instead simply do the call to <code>Navigator.of(context).popUntil...</code>. That would eliminate the need for the doing anything after bottomSheet.closed is called. However, depending on whatever else you might or might not need to do in your logic this may not be ideal (I can definitely see the issue with having the bottom sheet set off a change to the main part of the page and why you've tried to make that happen in the page's logic).</p>

<p>Also, when you're writing your code I'd <em>highly</em> recommend separating it into widgets - for example the bottom sheet should be its own widget. The more you have in a build function, the harder it is to follow and it can actually have an effect on performance as well. You should also avoid using GlobalKey instances wherever possible - you can generally either pass objects (or callbacks) down if it's only through a few layers, use the .of(context) pattern, or use inherited widgets.</p>

30790666,Error with not existing instance profile while trying to get a django project running on AWS Beanstalk,76620598,"<p>Earlier Elastic Beanstalk used to create a default EC2 instance profile named <code>aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role</code> the first time an AWS account create an environment. This instance profile included default managed policies. However, recent AWS security guidelines don’t allow an AWS service to automatically create roles with trust policies to other AWS services, EC2 in this case. Because of these security guidelines, Elastic Beanstalk no longer creates a default <code>aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role</code> instance profile.</p>
<p>So if your AWS account doesn’t have an EC2 instance profile, you must create one using the IAM service. You can then assign the EC2 instance profile to the new environments that you create.</p>
<p>Open IAM Console → In the navigation pane of the console, choose Roles and then create role → Under Trusted entity type, choose AWS service → Under Use case, choose EC2 → Choose Next → Attach- <em>AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier</em>, <em>AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier</em>, <em>AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker</em> → Choose Next → Enter a name for the role - <code>aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role</code> → Choose Create role.</p>
<p>If you already have an instance profile, make sure you have below-required policies. To meet the default use cases for an environment, these policies must be attached to the role for the EC2 instance profile:-</p>

32755983,Avoid The Divide by Zero Error Laravel Framework,65485952,"<p><strong>Here's an easy way.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than using a conditional clause to test for a zero value before every division operation, I use a <strong>custom helper</strong> to do this globally throughout my app and catch for division by zero. That way I don't have to worry if I got the screening code right in each place I use division, and I can globally turn it off or on easily for debugging. It's way easier than you would think.</p>
<p><strong>Create a blank file</strong> in which you will have the custom functions you want universally available throughout your app, and name it <code>helpers.php</code>. I put mine in <code>app/Helpers/helpers.php</code> but many put theirs in <code>app/helpers.php</code> or <code>app/Http/helpers.php</code>. Doesn't matter as long as you <strong>list it correctly in your <code>composer.json</code> autoload section</strong> like so (showing my location):</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;autoload&quot;: {
    &quot;classmap&quot;: [
      &quot;database&quot;
    ],
    &quot;psr-4&quot;: {
      &quot;App\\&quot;: &quot;app/&quot;
    },
    &quot;files&quot;: [
      &quot;app/Helpers/helpers.php&quot;
    ]
  },
</code></pre>
<p>This just ensures that your universal helper functions are pre-loaded and available throughout your app. Once you save <code>composer.json</code>, do a <code>composer dump-autoload</code> in your command-line terminal to set it up.</p>
<p>In your new blank <code>helpers.php</code> file, simply <strong>add the following</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

if (! function_exists('divnum')) {

        function divnum($numerator, $denominator)
        {
            return $denominator == 0 ? 0 : ($numerator / $denominator);
        }

    }
</code></pre>
<p>Correct protocol requires us to check to make sure there's not already a function in use with the same name as our new helper. It's not likely, but it you use a lot of packages you never know - best to check to be safe. Hence, we start with a <strong>check for the existence of our new function name</strong>.</p>
<p>Our function <code>divnum()</code> now <strong>simply divides any two numbers we give it</strong>, making sure that if the denominator (the dividing number) is zero, that we don't do the division and instead return an answer of zero. If the denominator is safe (!=0) then return the correct division answer. That way we avoid crashing with a division-by-zero error.</p>
<p><strong>Use it like so:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$answer = divnum($number1, $number2);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$answer = divnum(20,5);  //sets $answer variable to 4

$answer = divnum(20,0);  //sets $answer variable to 0 
</code></pre>
<p>So where before you would get a division-by-zero error with the following:</p>
<pre><code>$number1 = 2300;
$number2 = 0;
$answer = $number1/$number2;  //Your app crashes as you're dividing by zero
</code></pre>
<p>This is how you do division hereafter throughout your app:</p>
<pre><code>$number1 = 2300;
$number2 = 0;
$answer = divnum($number1,$number2);  //Your app continues without error and $answer as zero
</code></pre>
<p>Once you set up this simple helper, the coding difference thereafter is negligible and you never have to worry about division by zero again.</p>

67185714,How do I read npm &quot;conflicting peer dependency&quot; error messages?,73161619,"<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
<p>Check out <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yarn</a>.</p>
<p>I was able to circumvent the issue in NPM by using <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yarn</a> instead of NPM. Yarn is basically a wrapper utility around NPM that adds extra features, which are super useful. It's especially helpful for managing NPM dependencies better.</p>
<p>For instance, it can check if a package is already installed on your machine for another project, directly or as a sub dependency, and can reuse that installed version rather than re-installing a copy of the same package; saves space and makes for faster installations, especially with some of the most common dependencies.</p>
<p>So, due to the optimized way Yarn handles dependencies, I think it helps avoid this issue faced by the OP.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First, delete the <code>node_modules</code> folder in your project.</li>
<li>Yarn will complain about any <code>package-lock.json</code> files, so delete that too (or back it up, then delete it). Do not delete <code>package.json</code>, yarn will need that.</li>
<li>Simply install yarn: <code>npm i yarn</code> (you could do this globally, too).</li>
<li>Then run <code>yarn install</code> in your project directory.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong></p>
<p>Promoting a solution suggested by @IvanRubinson in the comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with deleting <code>package-lock.json</code> is that you lose the version pinning, so when you run yarn it will upgrade all dependencies, which can break stuff and cause dependency hell. Consider <code>yarn import</code> instead.</p>

How To Pass Options / Switches

You can pass options and switches in the following ways:

 * Unless stated otherwise, an option/switch should only be passed one
   time. Otherwise you may find weird/non-supported behavior.
 * `-`, `/`, or `--` (one character switches should not use `--`)
 * **Option Bundling / Bundled Options**: One character switches can be
   bundled. e.g. `-d` (debug), `-f` (force), `-v` (verbose), and `-y`
   (confirm yes) can be bundled as `-dfvy`.
 * NOTE: If `debug` or `verbose` are bundled with local options
   (not the global ones above), some logging may not show up until after
   the local options are parsed.
 * **Use Equals**: You can also include or not include an equals sign
   `=` between options and values.
 * **Quote Values**: When you need to quote an entire argument, such as
   when using spaces, please use a combination of double quotes and
   apostrophes (`&quot;'value'&quot;`). In cmd.exe you can just use double quotes
   (`&quot;value&quot;`) but in powershell.exe you should use backticks
   (`` `&quot;value`&quot; ``) or apostrophes (`'value'`). Using the combination
   allows for both shells to work without issue, except for when the next
   section applies.
 * **Pass quotes in arguments**: When you need to pass quoted values to
   to something like a native installer, you are in for a world of fun. In
   cmd.exe you must pass it like this: `-ia &quot;/yo=&quot;&quot;Spaces spaces&quot;&quot;&quot;`. In
   PowerShell.exe, you must pass it like this: `-ia '/yo=&quot;&quot;Spaces spaces&quot;&quot;'`.
   No other combination will work. In PowerShell.exe if you are on version
   v3+, you can try `--%` before `-ia` to just pass the args through as is,
   which means it should not require any special workarounds.
 * **Periods in PowerShell**: If you need to pass a period as part of a
   value or a path, PowerShell doesn't always handle it well. Please
   quote those values using &quot;Quote Values&quot; section above.
 * Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
   installing multiple packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, choco
   is going to look for and try to install version 1.0.0 of every
   package passed. So please split out multiple package calls when
   wanting to pass specific options.

Scripting / Integration - Best Practices / Style Guide

When writing scripts, such as PowerShell scripts passing options and
switches, there are some best practices to follow to ensure that you
don't run into issues later. This also applies to integrations that
are calling Chocolatey and parsing output. Chocolatey **uses**
PowerShell, but it is an exe, so it cannot return PowerShell objects.

Following these practices ensures both readability of your scripts AND
compatibility across different versions and editions of Chocolatey.
Following this guide will ensure your experience is not frustrating
based on choco not receiving things you think you are passing to it.

 * For consistency, always use `choco`, not `choco.exe`. Never use
   shortcut commands like `cinst` or `cup`.
 * Always have the command as the first argument to `choco. e.g.
   `choco install`, where `install` is the command.
 * If there is a subcommand, ensure that is the second argument. e.g.
   `choco source list`, where `source` is the command and `list` is the
   subcommand.
 * Typically the subject comes next. If installing packages, the
   subject would be the package names, e.g. `choco install pkg1 pkg2`.
 * Never use 'nupkg' or point directly to a nupkg file UNLESS using
   'choco push'. Use the source folder instead, e.g. `choco install
   &lt;package id&gt; --source=&quot;'c:\folder\with\package'&quot;` instead of
   `choco install DoNotDoThis.1.0.nupkg` or `choco install DoNotDoThis
    --source=&quot;'c:\folder\with\package\DoNotDoThis.1.0.nupkg'&quot;`.
 * Switches and parameters are called simply options. Options come
   after the subject. e.g. `choco install pkg1 --debug --verbose`.
 * Never use the force option (`--force`/`-f`) in scripts (or really
   otherwise as a default mode of use). Force is an override on
   Chocolatey behavior. If you are wondering why Chocolatey isn't doing
   something like the documentation says it should, it's likely because
   you are using force. Stop.
 * Always use full option name. If the short option is `-n`, and the
   full option is `--name`, use `--name`. The only acceptable short
   option for use in scripts is `-y`. Find option names in help docs
   online or through `choco -?` /`choco [Command Name] -?`.
 * For scripts that are running automated, always use `-y`. Do note
   that even with `-y` passed, some things / state issues detected will
   temporarily stop for input - the key here is temporarily. They will
   continue without requiring any action after the temporary timeout
   (typically 30 seconds).
 * Full option names are prepended with two dashes, e.g. `--` or
   `--debug --verbose --ignore-proxy`.
 * When setting a value to an option, always put an equals (`=`)
   between the name and the setting, e.g. `--source=&quot;'local'&quot;`.
 * When setting a value to an option, always surround the value
   properly with double quotes bookending apostrophes, e.g.
   `--source=&quot;'internal_server'&quot;`.
 * If you are building PowerShell scripts, you can most likely just
   simply use apostrophes surrounding option values, e.g.
   `--source='internal_server'`.
 * Prefer upgrade to install in scripts. You can't `install` to a newer
   version of something, but you can `choco upgrade` which will do both
   upgrade or install (unless switched off explicitly).
 * If you are sharing the script with others, pass `--source` to be
   explicit about where the package is coming from. Use full link and
   not source name ('https://chocolatey.org/api/v2' versus
   'chocolatey').
 * If parsing output, you might want to use `--limit-output`/`-r` to
   get output in a more machine parseable format. NOTE: Not all
   commands handle return of information in an easily digestible
   output.
 * Use exit codes to determine status. Chocolatey exits with 0 when
   everything worked appropriately and other exits codes like 1 when
   things error. There are package specific exit codes that are
   recommended to be used and reboot indicating exit codes as well. To
   check exit code when using PowerShell, immediately call
   `$exitCode = $LASTEXITCODE` to get the value choco exited with.

Here's an example following bad practices (line breaks added for
 readability):

  `choco install pkg1 -y -params '/Option:Value /Option2:value with
   spaces' --c4b-option 'Yaass' --option-that-is-new 'dude upgrade'`

Now here is that example written with best practices (again line
 breaks added for readability - there are not line continuations
 for choco):

  `choco upgrade pkg1 -y --source=&quot;'https://chocolatey.org/api/v2'&quot;
   --package-parameters=&quot;'/Option:Value /Option2:value with spaces'&quot;
   --c4b-option=&quot;'Yaass'&quot; --option-that-is-new=&quot;'dude upgrade'&quot;`

Note the differences between the two:
 * Which is more self-documenting?
 * Which will allow for the newest version of something installed or
   upgraded to (which allows for more environmental consistency on
   packages and versions)?
 * Which may throw an error on a badly passed option?
 * Which will throw errors on unknown option values? See explanation
   below.

Chocolatey ignores options it doesn't understand, but it can only
 ignore option values if they are tied to the option with an
 equals sign ('='). Note those last two options in the examples above?
 If you roll off of a commercial edition or someone with older version
 attempts to run the badly crafted script `--c4b-option 'Yaass'
 --option-that-is-new 'dude upgrade'`, they are likely to see errors on
 'Yaass' and 'dude upgrade' because they are not explicitly tied to the
 option they are written after. Now compare that to the other script.
 Choco will ignore `--c4b-option=&quot;'Yaass'&quot;` and
 `--option-that-is-new=&quot;'dude upgrade'&quot;` as a whole when it doesn't
 register the options. This means that your script doesn't error.

Following these scripting best practices will ensure your scripts work
 everywhere they are used and with newer versions of Chocolatey.

<p>Instead, go to the parent directory, with the <code>.sln</code> file and use the docker <code>-f</code> option to specify the Dockerfile to use in the subfolder:</p>
<pre><code>cd \Workerservice2
docker build -f WorkerService2\Dockerfile --force-rm -t worker2/try7 .

docker run -it worker2/try7    
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Note the final dot on the <code>docker build</code> command.</p>
<p>For docker the final part of the command is the location of the files that Docker will work with. <em>Usually</em> this is the folder with the Dockerfile in, but that's what's different about how VS does it. In this case the dockerfile is specified with the <code>-f</code>. Any paths (such as with the <code>COPY</code> instruction in the dockerfile) are relative to the location specified. The <code>.</code> means &quot;current directory&quot;, which in my example is <code>\WorkerService2</code>.</p>
<p>I got to this stage by inspecting the output of the build process, with verbosity set to Detailed.
If you choose Tools / Options / Projects and Solutions / Build and Run you can adjust the build output verbosity, I made mine Detailed.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think I've worked out why Visual Studio does it this way.
It allows the project references in the same solution to be copied in.</p>
<p>If it was set up to do <code>docker build</code> from the project folder, docker would not be able to <code>COPY</code> any of the other projects in the solution in. But the way this is set up, with current directory being the solution folder, you can copy referenced projects (subfolders) into your docker build process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mongoose lets you start using your models immediately, without waiting for mongoose to establish a connection to MongoDB.</p>
<p>That's because mongoose buffers model function calls internally. This
buffering is convenient, but also a common source of confusion.
Mongoose will not throw any errors by default if you use a model
without connecting.</p>

<p>Your model is being called before the connection is established.

77167625,Decimal to Binary Number Representation Logical Error,77167754,"<p>I'm afraid your method does not work. Instead of testing if the remainder is equal to <code>x</code>, which will be true for all powers of 2 greater than <code>x</code>, you should use the bitwise and operator (<code>&amp;</code>) to test if the corresponding bit is set.</p>
<p>I don't understand either why you make <code>binary</code> call itself recursively, nor why you make the temporary variables global.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>int main(int x)</code> is not a valid prototype for the <code>main</code> function, and defining <code>x</code> this way in <code>main</code> hides the global variable with the same name.</p>
<p>Finally <code>(int)pow(2, exponent)</code> has undefined behavior for the first iteration as 2<sup>31</sup> is beyond the range of 32-bit signed integers.</p>
<p>Here is a modified version:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void binary(unsigned int x, int binary_array[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++) {
        if (x &amp; (1U &lt;&lt; (31 - i)))

            binary_array[i] = 0;

<p>That leaves you 23 bits which can present only certain lenght integer as on the right side (the decimal maximum comes from these bits as technical limitation, and they can be only this accurate before rounding kicks in)</p>
<p>See: <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9dxrq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">how the bits are used for floating point numbers in 32bits</a></p>
<p>In order to fix that ^^ remember to round you decimal number to maximum of 5 length as the fraction on the right side. As any decimals more accurate will get goofed, like 0,123456 you would like to round to 0,12346 before trying to fit it to 32bits.</p>

What I had previously done was importing some classes manually (dropped the .cs files to the project title), and it was working fine yesterday at another computer. Now I'm on a different computer and receive this error. One problem at the very beginning was when I imported the classes, they belonged to a different namespace. So at first I decided to change the namespace for all classes to ""normalize"" the issue. It happened to work for writing code, but at runtime it returned errors. So what I finally did was returning to the original namespace and just include 'using NameOfMyImportedNamespace' on top of the Default.aspx.cs file.
New errors relating namespace showed up again. So I finally solved it by also renaming the previous namespace (original) on file Default.aspx.designer.cs to NameOfMyImportedNamespace and it worked!
However, as today I was receiving this new error, I discovered the namespace on Default.aspx.designer.cs file had been renamed back to its original one. So this time when I renamed it, I payed attention to the red cursor Visual Studio draws behind the word you changed, and there was an option to rename that namespace throughout the whole project itself. So I did it and it finally worked.
I supposed my project name would be renamed also, but it didn't, so I think it could be the appropriate solution to your problem.
By the way, I started writing this code yesterday on VS2010 Ultimate running under Windows 7, and the error happened and was also solved at this other computer I'm using now, running VS2010 Enterprise under Windows XP. So I suppose it shouldn't be a O.S. or VS version issue, because it could be fixed by just renaming the namespace.</p>

<p>do i need to configure proxy settings? because my office has got proxy servers.</p>

<p>Yes, you can do so by setting <code>HTTP_PROXY</code>, and <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code> environment variables.</p>
<p>See &quot;<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/5378094/6309"">Syncing with github</a>&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>set HTTPS_PROXY=http://&lt;login_internet&gt;:&lt;password_internet&gt;@aproxy:aport
set HTTP_PROXY=http://&lt;login_internet&gt;:&lt;password_internet&gt;@aproxy:aport
set NO_PROXY=localhost,my.company
</code></pre>
<p>(To avoid putting your credentials -- username/password -- in clear in the proxy URL, see below)</p>
<p>Note the <code>NO_PROXY</code>, to allow to access internal site to your company</p>
<p>You also can register that in your git config:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global http.proxy http://&lt;login_internet&gt;:&lt;password_internet&gt;@aproxy:aport
</code></pre>
<p>But if you have incorrect proxy Git settings, remove them:</p>
<pre><code>cd /path/to/repo
git config --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --system --unset http.proxy

git config --unset https.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
git config --system --unset https.proxy

# double-check with:
git config -l --show-origin | grep -i proxy
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>No credentials needed: use <a href=""https://github.com/genotrance/px"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>genotrance/px</code></a>.<br />
If you are, as I am, in a company behind a NTLM proxy, all you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>unzip <a href=""https://github.com/genotrance/px/releases/download/v0.4.0/px-v0.4.0.zip"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>px-v0.4.0.zip</code></a> anywhere you want</li>
<li>change the <code>px.ini</code> config file (put it in <code>%USERPROFILE%</code>), chaging the <code>server</code> line:
<pre><code>[proxy]
server = proxy.my.company:8080  &lt;= use your company proxy:port
listen = 127.0.0.1
port = 3128
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>use HTTP(S) proxy variable <strong>without your credentials!</strong> (the <code>px</code> proxy will reuse the ones from the current Widows session, either through <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rpc/security-support-provider-interface-sspi-"" rel=""noreferrer"">Microsoft SSPI</a> or <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview#:%7E:text=Kerberos%20is%20an%20authentication%20protocol,Server%202012%20and%20Windows%208."" rel=""noreferrer"">Microsoft Kerberos</a>)</li>

<li>I can run <code>dotnet restore</code> on the same Linux machine for other (older) versions and it's fine</li>

<p>It just seems that <code>dotnet restore</code> decides, for whatever reason, that it's not even going to try to look for the new version of the package.</p>

This is an essential nuget library which is required by dotnet.exe to restore nuget packages.  For .net core projects, that framework needs to be version 4.7 or higher.  Anyway, the resolution was that we had to make adjustments to our internal nuget server to account for the changes from nuget.org.</p>

<pre><code>export DISABLE_BCOLZ_AVX2=true &amp;&amp; export DISABLE_BCOLZ_SSE2=true

<p>SSE2 and AVX2 are instruction sets only found in Intel and AMD CPUs, also known as x86 architecture. The dependency bcolz of the library zipline takes advantage of this architecture. Therefore, SSE2 and AVX2 are enabled by default. To build wheel for bcolz on ARM architecture, one needs to disable x86 specific instructions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create two environment variables in the ""System Variables"" section: <code>SWIG_DIR</code> and <code>SWIG_EXECUTABLE</code>. These must point to <code>/path/to/the/swig/dir/</code> and <code>/path/to/the/swig/dir/swig.exe</code> respectively.</li>
<li>After this, add one more entry to the PATH variable: <code>/path/to/the/swig/dir</code>. Test this out by typing <code>swig</code> in the command prompt. It should display a message <code>must specify an input file. Use -help for available options</code>.</li>
<li>Restart the computer to apply all environment variable changes. <code>find_package(SWIG required)</code> should work correctly now.</li>

<p>Unfortunately, if a find script does not work as expected and you do not see right away why that is the case, you usually have to dig into its source. In your case, it looks like CMake was able to find and run the SWIG executable, but then failed to obtain the swig directory.</p>

<p>Try manually running <code>swig -swiglib</code> and check that the printed directory indeed contains a <code>swig.swg</code> file. Also, be sure that the swig executable found by CMake is actually the correct one (you can verify this by inspecting the value of <code>SWIG_EXECUTABLE</code> in either the <code>cmake-gui</code>, the <code>ccmake</code> curses interface, or in the <code>CMakeCache.txt</code> file directly).</p>

<p>Note that CMake will <em>not</em> update the executable path once it has been found! So if you make changes to your system that influence the executable location, you will have to clear the cache (eg. by deleting the <code>CMakeCache.txt</code>) and re-run CMake for the changes to take effect.</p>

55785581,"SocketException: OS Error: Connection refused, errno = 111 in flutter using django backend",55786011,"<p>Harnish, need a few more details in-order to debug this error.</p>

<ol>
<li>Are you running the server locally or communicating with a remote server?</li>
<li>Are you running the app on the Android Emulator?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Possible Solution:</strong></p>

<p>If you're running the server locally and using the Android emulator, then your server endpoint should be <code>10.0.2.2:8000</code> instead of <code>localhost:8000</code> as AVD uses <code>10.0.2.2</code> as an alias to your host loopback interface (i.e) <code>localhost</code></p>

<p><strong>Note on Futures</strong></p>

<p>I noticed above that the code is using await and then on the same line. This can be confusing, to be clear, <code>await</code> is used to suspend execution until a future completes, and <code>then</code> is a callback function to execute after a future completed. The same could be written as below</p>

<pre><code>void myFunction() async {
    var data = {};
    var response = await http.post(URL, headers:headers, body:data);
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        print(reponse.body);
    } else {
       print('A network error occurred');
    }

<pre><code>if (x &gt; 6)

<p>to</p>
<pre><code>if (x &gt; 6) {
       printf(&quot;Wrong option!\n&quot;);
       goto repeat;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can only omit the braces for single statements.</p>
<p>But I would strongly advice against using <code>goto</code> like this. <code>goto</code> has it's uses, but this is not one of them. You could rewrite your code like this:</p>
<pre><code>int main()
{
    while(1) {
        printf(&quot;choose an option: \n1:Draw\n2:Even or Odd:\n3:Text type\n4:How to Dec\n5:Base to Dec:\n6:Count to Bits\n0:Exit\n&quot;); 
        int x;
        scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;x); 
        if (x &gt; 6) {
           printf(&quot;Wrong option!\n&quot;);
        }

        if (x == 1) {
           printf(&quot;Drawing&quot;);
           break;
        }
        if (x == 0) {
           printf(&quot;we are out!\n&quot;);
           break;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's not how I would have written it. I changed to a while loop with as few changes as possible. I would have done something like this:</p>
<pre><code>int x = 6;
while(x == 6) {
    printf(&quot;choose an option: \n1:Draw\n2:Even or Odd:\n3:Text type\n4:How to Dec\n5:Base to Dec:\n6:Count to Bits\n0:Exit\n&quot;); 

    // Always check scanf for errors
    if(scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;x) != 1) { perror(&quot;Input error&quot;); exit(1); }

    switch(x) {
        case 1: printf(&quot;Drawing&quot;); break;
        case 0: printf(&quot;we are out!\n&quot;); break;
        default: printf(&quot;Wrong option!\n&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are only two cases where I would ever consider using <code>goto</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To break out of a nested loop</p>
</li>
<li><p>To clean up allocated resources in a function on failure</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example of breaking out of nested loop:</p>
<pre><code>while(1) {
    while(1) {
        if(&lt;condition&gt;) goto END;
    }
}
END:
</code></pre>
<p>Example of cleanup:</p>
<pre><code>void foo() {
    char *p = malloc(1);
    if(!p) goto END;
    char *q = malloc(1);
    if(!q) goto P;

    // Do stuff

    free(q);
P:
    free(p);
END:
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the cleanup example is not very good, since you can safely free a NULL pointer, which <code>malloc</code> returns on failure. An example with <code>fopen</code> would be more appropriate. But it demonstrates the general principle. That you do the cleanup in reverse order and jump to the appropriate place in case of failure.</p>
<p>And whatever you do, NEVER jump backwards with goto. Only jump forwards. Or at least I have never seen a case where a backwards jump would be motivated.</p>
<p>In languages that support exceptions, you would typically use exceptions for both of these cases. First example would be something like this pseudo:</p>
<pre><code>try {
    while(1) {
        while(1) {
            if(&lt;condition&gt;) throw MyException;
        }
    }
} catch MyException {}
</code></pre>
"
64136544,How to use goto without getting this error?,64136711,"<p>The problem, as mentioned in the comments, is that <code>goto</code> is always executed because it does not depend on the condition, it's out of its scope.</p>
<p>In C the only statement dependant on the condition is the one in the next line, to have more than one you'll need to increase the codition scope using <code>{}</code> to envelop the statements that should depend on it, <em>i.e.</em>:</p>
<pre><code>if(...){ 
   statement; 
   statement;
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><em>if you have other solution that restarts the main program after an execution please tell me</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many possiblities to achieve the same result. I would choose a simple and elegant solution using a <code>do-while</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>int main()
{
    int x = 0; //initialize the control variable to avoid problems in case of bad input

    do {
        printf(&quot;choose an option: \n1:Draw\n2:Even or Odd:\n3:Text type\n4:How to Dec\n5:Base to Dec:\n6:Count to Bits\n0:Exit\n&quot;);
    } while (scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;x) &amp;&amp; x &gt; 6 &amp;&amp; printf(&quot;Wrong option!\n&quot;));
    //including scanf in the condition has the advantage of also checking its return value

    if (x == 1)
        printf(&quot;Drawing&quot;);
    if (x == 0)
        printf(&quot;we are out!\n&quot;);

    return 0;
}

"
64136544,How to use goto without getting this error?,64136853,"<p>This formatting of the statements</p>
<pre><code>if (x &gt; 6)
   printf(&quot;Wrong option!\n&quot;);

<p>does not mean that the statement with goto is a sub-statement of the if statement. Actually you have</p>
<pre><code>if (x &gt; 6)
{
   printf(&quot;Wrong option!\n&quot;);
}
goto repeat;
</code></pre>
<p>Thus the goto statement gets the control in any case.</p>
<p>It is a bad idea to use the goto statement. It would be much better to use for example the do-while statement along with a switch statement the following way</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int x = 0;

    do
    {
        printf(&quot;choose an option: \n1:Draw\n2:Even or Odd:\n3:Text type\n4:How to Dec\n5:Base to Dec:\n6:Count to Bits\n0:Exit\n&quot;); 
        scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;x);

        switch( x )
        { 
        case 0:
           printf(&quot;we are out!\n&quot;);
           break;
        case 1:

            break;
        }
    } while ( x != 0 );

    return 0;

</code></pre>
<p>Also you could introduce an enumeration the enumerator constants of which will be used in the case labels.</p>

<p>Which was to simply uninstall then reinstall copilot then run CTRL+R (Developer: Reload Window), this too didn't work out.</p>
<p>There's a good chance that <strong>all you'd have to do is retrigger the authentication flow</strong> considering that the developer tools console reports that copilot is &quot;missing an auth token&quot; (but no one knows how to retrigger it).</p>
<p>In addition to the above, I tried running CTRL+SHIFT+P then ran &quot;Open Copilot&quot;, which resulted in the error</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the 3.5 LLVM toolchain it seems that the symlink

  <p>The workaround (of course) is to manually correct the symlink.</p>
  
  <p>For the 3.4 toolchain the /usr/lib/clang/3.4/include doesn't exist at
  all. I have not tried LLVM 3.4 on Ubuntu so I don't know if createing

70677227,Visual Studio Code. Error while turning on Settings Sync: Authentication failed,73039881,"<p>This just happened to me on a fresh install on a fresh machine.  I intentionally tried to sync first thing, before installing anything locally to keep it 'clean' and consistent.  It had been working fine on 3 other machines.  Whether coincidence or not, I was also using my GitHub linked account.  Here is how I fixed:</p>
<ol>
<li>With account set to 'GitHub: Logged In' in a broken state, I went to 'Setting Sync: Configure' and de-selected 'Settings, Key Bindings'.</li>
<li>Wait a few mins and my sync of Extensions (and other) succeeded, the logs showed a clean operation.</li>
<li>Re-enabled 'Settings' and it succeeded after a couple minutes as well.  I verified this both in logs and by looking at my 'Preferences: Open Settings.json' which had been empty and was now populated from sync.'</li>
</ol>
<p>Wild theory, something about the settings.json coming in first, before the extensions was blowing up VS trying to sync settings for extensions not installed... but this makes no real sense obviously, it shouldn't care about json config nodes for extensions that are not yet installed.</p>
<p>##Also, sidenote:</p>
<p>As a final step, I tried Re-enabling 'Key Bindings' (of which I have no special config afaik) and it <em>may</em> still be erroring out?  It is according to the logs.</p>
<p>But leaving it with all sync settings enabled <em>seemed</em> to be working aside from some noise in the logs.</p>

<li>Download the appropriate .msi installer from the <a href=""https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/releases"" rel=""noreferrer"">Npgsql releases page</a>.  The version you need depends on your version of Excel.  I am running Office 365, which required version 4.0.x (I installed 4.0.10, download <a href=""https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases/download/v4.0.10/Npgsql-4.0.10.msi"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>).</li>
<li>Run the installer.  During the install there is an option to install to the GAC <em>which is switched off by default</em> - you must select to have the files installed to the GAC.</li>
<li>Reboot your computer and you should be able to connect setup a Postgres connection in PowerBI or Excel.</li>
</ol>
<h3>AWS RDS Postgres - additional requirement</h3>
<p>If you are connecting to a Postgres cluster running in AWS, when you attempt to connect to Postgres after installing the Npgsql provider you may get an error saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how to fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the public keys for AWS RDS regions: <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem</a></li>
<li>Convert the bundle to a Windows certificate in P7B/PKCS#7 format.  There are many ways to do this, and easy one is to use <a href=""https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html</a>.</li>
<li>In Windows, search for the &quot;Manage User Certificates&quot; utility and open it.
<ol>
<li>Right-click on &quot;Trusted Root Certificate Authorities&quot;, &quot;All Tasks&quot;, &quot;Import...&quot;</li>
<li>Select the .p7b file which was the output of converting the AWS keys to P7B format.</li>
<li>Choose to place all certificates in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.</li>
<li>You will probably have to confirm for each certificate - there is one per AWS region</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to connect to your AWS RDS Postgres database from PowerBI or Excel.</p>

56873278,How to fix: error: &#39;&lt;filename&gt;&#39; does not have a commit checked out fatal: adding files failed when inputting &quot;git add .&quot; in command prompt,66365303,"<p>To expand on both <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/58530721/1256452"">the accepted answer from Mario Zigliotto</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/65613690/1256452"">Albert's answer</a>, the reason this occurs is because of <em>submodules</em>.  Here is a simple way to re-create the problem:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>$ mkdir empty-submodule &amp;&amp; cd empty-submodule
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in [path ending in empty-submodule/.git]
$ mkdir sub &amp;&amp; (cd sub &amp;&amp; git init)
Initialized empty Git repository in ... [path ending in empty-submodule/sub/.git]
$ ls
sub
$ ls -a sub
.       ..      .git
$ git add .
error: 'sub/' does not have a commit checked out
fatal: adding files failed
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the subdirectory <code>sub</code> is itself a Git repository, but <em>no commit is checked out in this subdirectory</em>.  This is a simple statement of fact, true in this case because I created <code>sub</code>, went into it, and created a new, empty Git repository there.  So <em>that</em> Git repository has no commits at all.</p>
<p>To the above fact, we add one more: <em>No Git repository can hold another Git repository inside it.</em>  The reason for this has to do with security, but for our purpose here, the important <strong>side effect</strong> of this fact is that an attempt to add a sub-repository to a repository (like the superproject in <code>empty-submodule</code>) does not add the repository itself.  Instead, it adds a <em>reference to a commit within the repository</em>.  This is how submodules are implemented.<sup>1</sup>  But to refer to some commit <em>within</em> the submodule, the submodule itself has to <em>have some commit checked out</em>.</p>
<p>The way to fix this really depends on the result you want.  See the next section for more information about this.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>1</sup>Technically, submodules are implemented with two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each commit in the <em>superproject</em> (the &quot;outer&quot; repository) has a reference to a commit within the submodule.</li>
<li>In order to be able to run <code>git clone</code> <em>on</em> the submodule, the outer repository should also contain a <code>.gitmodules</code> file.  This file will hold the instructions that tell the superproject Git how to <code>git clone</code> the submodule.  Once the submodule repository exists, the superproject Git never needs to run <code>git clone</code> on it again.  So it's possible to accidentally, or on purpose, <em>omit</em> the <code>.gitmodules</code> file entirely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this produces a superproject that is difficult to use.  I like to call this a <em>half-assed submodule</em>.  If it were fully-assed, the superproject would be able to clone the submodule, but since the <code>.gitmodules</code> file is missing, it can't.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Fixing the problem</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to fix the problem.  Before you pick one, you should know whether you <em>want</em> to have a submodule.  There's no one correct answer here, as the question of <em>should I use a submodule</em> is a bit like <em>which flavor of ice cream should I pick:</em> different people have different preferences.</p>
<p><strong>If you don't want a submodule at all</strong> you will need to move or remove the <code>.git</code> subdirectory within the subdirectory in question, e.g.:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>rm -rf sub/.git
</code></pre>
<p>(see also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/64514353/1256452"">Nissan's answer</a> if using PowerShell on Windows).</p>
<p><strong>Before you do that</strong>, you should:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Determine whether you want to keep the other <em>repository</em>.  If so, <strong>do not</strong> remove it!  Just move it somewhere else, e.g., <code>mkdir ../keep &amp;&amp; mv sub/.git ../keep</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determine whether you need to <code>git checkout</code> some commit or branch before moving or removing the <em>repository</em> (the <code>.git</code> directory).  If so, enter the submodule and check out the desired commit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you do want a submodule</strong>, you may need to make some commit(s) within the submodule, or check out some existing commit, just as in step 2 above.  Once the submodule repository is on the correct commit, you can <code>git add</code> it.</p>
<p>Here is an example of creating a commit in my submodule named <code>sub</code>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>$ cd sub
$ echo this is the submodule &gt; README.md
$ git add .
$ git commit -m initial
[master (root-commit) c834131] initial
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
$ cd ..
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the submodule has a commit, I can add it to the superproject.  There's a bit of a hitch here though, as I should <em>also</em> create the <code>.gitmodule</code> file mentioned in footnote 1 above.  The <code>git submodule add</code> command does everything for you, but you need to know where you'll <code>git push</code> this submodule repository.  For instance:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>$ git submodule add ssh://git@github.com/place/where/submodule/lives.git sub
Adding existing repo at 'sub' to the index
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is now ready to commit in the superproject:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        new file:   .gitmodules
        new file:   sub

$ cat .gitmodules
[submodule &quot;sub&quot;]
        path = sub
        url = ssh://git@github.com/place/where/submodule/lives.git
</code></pre>
<p>The submodule has not actually been sent to GitHub yet.  Before anyone else will be able to use the <em>superproject</em>, I'd have to create this GitHub repository, giving it sufficient (e.g., public) access, and <code>git push</code> the submodule commit <em>to</em> that GitHub repository.  Then I can <code>git push</code> my commit in my superproject to whatever location <em>that</em> repository should live at.  Then you—the generic &quot;you&quot;—can <code>git clone</code> the <em>superproject</em>, which now has a <code>.gitmodules</code> file with instructions by which your Git will be able to run <code>git clone ssh://git@github.com/place/where/submodule/lives.git sub</code>.</p>
<p>Submodules have a bunch of usability issues, with all of the above complications being one of them.  Be sure you know what you're getting into.</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>        # do authentication later

<p><strong>Details:</strong> I was starting a few hundreds subprocesses trying to get a value from <code>multiprocessing.Manager().dict</code> object at the very start of my program (basically instantly parallel). First few worked fine, but then they started to fail sporadically.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in my case, this only happened under VSCode debugger. I have found a mailing list <a href=""https://python-bugs-list.python.narkive.com/2zP5q8dK/issue3419-multiprocessing-module-is-racy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">discussion</a> mentioning this issue more than 10 years ago. Looking at the source code of <code>multiprocessing</code> I found out that the backlog limit is still hard-coded (seems to get increased from 5 to 16 in modern versions). I increased it to 64 and all errors were gone.</p>
<p>So if the pending connections queue reaches the limit, all new connections will be refused. Especially when you run your code under debugger, connections are getting served a tick slower and the backlog buffer may get full when hundreds of them are flowing fast in parallel.</p>

<p>I had the similar problem and tried all of the random solutions mentioned in the comments and as answers, but non of them worked so I decided to create a new project and copy-paste my codes piece by piece until it breaks! Here's what was the error in my case:</p>
<p>I have one class marked with <code>@Model</code>, it contains a <code>Date</code> object and two custom typed <code>array</code>s. In my Home screen, I fetch data like this:</p>
<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>@Query(
  sort: [SortDescriptor(\.date, order: .reverse)]
) private var items: [Item]
</code></pre>
<p>and I show them in a <code>List</code> like this:</p>
<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>List(selection: $detailSelection) {
  ForEach(items) { item in
    NavigationLink(destination: {
      ItemDetailsView(item: item)
    }, label: {
      HomeItemRow(item: item)
    })
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The problem was in the <code>ItemDetailsView</code> screen where I defined the initializer like:</strong></p>
<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>init(item: Item) {
  self.item = item
}
</code></pre>
<p>When I changed it to have a default value, it fixed the build error!!</p>

<pre><code>No exact matches in call to instance method 'setValue'

<p>In my case the problem was the types in the models. I've defined a few enums to help me reason about certain things. But these types weren't marked with the <code>@Model</code> macro. And somehow the compiler couldn't resolve the macros around these and has thrown the errors as above.</p>
<p>For me what worked, was simply changing in the model the type from <code>enum</code> to its <code>rawValue</code> type and save that instead. Possibly one of your types <code>Space</code>, <code>Character</code>, <code>Team</code>... also uses an enum or other unsupported type?</p>
<p>Overall changing the types to a basic ones (like Int, Double, String etc) is less than ideal solution, possibly there's a better workaround, but for a month old technology, I can continue exploring what's there and hopefully we'll get some better examples on how to store things.</p>

71848934,Uncaught (in promise) Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist,73276111,"<p>Thanks for posting, I also had a similar issue and for my particular problem I could not find a proper answer in particular for Google Chrome Extension Manifest Version 3.</p>
<p>In my case, I want to send the idle state with <code>chrome.idle.onStateChanged</code> from a <code>background.js</code> to a <code>contentScript.js</code>. As I am building an extension for reddit, the <code>contentScript.js</code> is only injected into pages which match the URL pattern for reddit.</p>
<pre><code>chrome.idle.onStateChanged.addListener(
  (browserActivityState) =&gt; {
    chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, (tabs) =&gt; {
        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, { browserActivityState: browserActivityState });
    });
  }
)
</code></pre>
<p>Then I got the same error as you.</p>
<p><strong>Uncaught (in promise) Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.</strong></p>
<p>I realized while reading the error message, that this happened because I want to send a message to a page which does not have <code>contentScript.js</code>.</p>
<p>I also noticed that it occurred for when I had Chrome but not a reddit page open, I then for example locked my screen which triggers an idle change event and hence my <code>background.js</code> tries send a message to a page.</p>
<p>The problem is, reddit has not been open in the last active tab and therefore the tab to which this message has been sent does not have a <code>contentScript.js</code> injected.</p>
<p>As preliminary solution, not sure if this is the best style but it does the job, I check if the tab I am sending a message to does match the URL of pages where I am injecting the <code>contentScript.js</code> into with <code>if (tabs[0].url.match('https:\/\/.*.reddit.com\/.*'))</code>.</p>
<pre><code>chrome.idle.onStateChanged.addListener(
  (browserActivityState) =&gt; {
    console.log('browserActivityState changed')
    chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, (tabs) =&gt; {

        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, { browserActivityState: browserActivityState });
      }
    });
  }
)
</code></pre>
<p>This ensures, I am not sending a message to a tab with <strong>'no receiving end'</strong> and so far the error is gone.</p>
<p>Maybe you can look in this direction as well for your problem solving.</p>

<p>Note that this solution is limited by <a href=""http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_call_a.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">call-arguments-limit</a> as described further below.</p>
<p>You can use this idea to write a macro, e.g.:</p>
<pre class=""lang-lisp prettyprint-override""><code>(defmacro format-delimited (delimiter stream format-string &amp;rest args)
  `(format ,stream
           ,`(concatenate 'string &quot;~{&quot; ,format-string &quot;~^&quot; ,delimiter &quot;~}&quot;)
           (list ,@args)))

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>CL-USER&gt; (format-delimited &quot;;&quot; nil &quot;~A&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;)
&quot;a;b;c&quot;
CL-USER&gt; (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3))
           (format-delimited &quot;;&quot; nil &quot;~A&quot; a b c))
&quot;1;2;3&quot;
CL-USER&gt; (let ((a 'x) (b 'y) (c 'z))
           (format-delimited &quot;;&quot; nil &quot;&lt;~A&gt;&quot; a b c))
&quot;&lt;X&gt;;&lt;Y&gt;;&lt;Z&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure that there is any reason to write this as a macro; the above could be more simply written as a function:</p>
<pre class=""lang-lisp prettyprint-override""><code>(defun format-delimited (delimiter stream fmt-str &amp;rest args)
  (format stream
          (concatenate 'string &quot;~{&quot; fmt-str &quot;~^&quot; delimiter &quot;~}&quot;)
          args))
</code></pre>
<p>This can be made more flexible, allowing the choice of placing delimiter strings before and after the output. This would accommodate OP example output <code>&quot;a;b;c;&quot;</code> as well as <code>&quot;a;b;c&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;;a;b;c&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;;a;b;c;&quot;</code>. In the <code>format-delimited</code> function below the arguments to be printed are placed in a list; this makes it easier to use keyword arguments and clarifies the API:</p>
<pre class=""lang-lisp prettyprint-override""><code>(defun format-delimited (stream fmt-str args &amp;key (delim &quot; &quot;) init end)
  (let ((init (if init delim &quot;&quot;))
        (end (if end delim &quot;&quot;)))
    (format stream
            (concatenate 'string init &quot;~{&quot; fmt-str &quot;~^&quot; delim &quot;~}&quot; end)
            args)))

<h2>When You Really Want to Join Strings</h2>
<p>I was led to believe that OP wanted to format the values of variables using delimiters by the example <code>(format nil &quot;~a;~b;~c;&quot; var1 var2 var3)</code>. The final version of <code>format-delimited</code> above satisfies all of OP requirements, and provides quite a bit of flexibility in how output is formatted.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the non-standard library function <code>str:join</code> can solve OP problem, and this may be true. It should be noted that this solution can join strings together with a delimiter, but does not provide a way to add the delimiter to the end (or the beginning) of the output.</p>
<p>If what is needed is a way to join strings with a delimiter, here is a portable solution written in standard Common Lisp that also allows flexibility in placing a delimiter string at either or both ends of the output:</p>
<pre class=""lang-lisp prettyprint-override""><code>(defun string-delimited (args &amp;key (delim &quot; &quot;) init end)
  (do* ((init (if init delim &quot;&quot;))
        (end (if end delim &quot;&quot;))
        (acc (list init)))
       ((endp args) (apply #'concatenate 'string (nreverse (cons end acc))))
    (push (pop args) acc)
    (when args (push delim acc))))
</code></pre>
<p>The above definition of <code>string-delimited</code> has a problem: the Common Lisp standard only requires that a function be able to handle 50 arguments. Because of this an input <code>args</code> list of more than 24 strings may fail when <code>concatenate</code> is applied to its arguments. Yet
this may be fine in practice for many uses; SBCL allows up to 1,073,741,824 arguments to be passed into function calls. Other implementations are less generous, e.g., Clisp allows only up to 4,096 arguments in function calls. The limit for any particular implementation can be found by checking the value of <a href=""http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_call_a.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">call-arguments-limit</a>.</p>
<p>If this is a concern you can write <code>string-delimited</code> while avoiding <code>apply</code>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-lisp prettyprint-override""><code>(defun string-delimited (args &amp;key (delim &quot; &quot;) init end)
  (do* ((init (if init delim &quot;&quot;))
        (end (if end delim &quot;&quot;))
        (acc (string init)))
       ((endp args) (concatenate 'string (nreverse acc) end))
    (setf acc (concatenate 'string (pop args) acc))
    (when args (setf acc (concatenate 'string delim acc)))))
</code></pre>
<p>There are probably better ways to write this function; this implementation may be less efficient than the first one since <code>concatenate</code> is called many times, but it is not subject to the function arguments limit.</p>
<p>Example usages:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>CL-USER&gt; (string-delimited '(&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;) :delim &quot;;&quot;)
&quot;a;b;c&quot;
CL-USER&gt; (string-delimited '(&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;) :delim &quot;;&quot; :end t)
&quot;a;b;c;&quot;
CL-USER&gt; (string-delimited '(&quot;a&quot;) :delim &quot;;&quot;)
&quot;a&quot;
CL-USER&gt; (string-delimited '() :delim &quot;;&quot;)
&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>A Better Version of <code>string-delimited</code></h2>
<p>Here is an improved version of <code>string-delimited</code> that uses <code>reduce</code> instead of <code>apply</code>. Using <code>reduce</code> avoids the problems with function argument limits that <code>apply</code> had. This version also mutates the result list instead of creating a fresh list when the end delimiter is added. Instead of using <code>do</code>, this version uses <code>loop</code> which seems to make the code a bit more clear and concise. Finally, the <code>show-empty</code> keyword has been added to control handling of empty input lists. Previous versions have always shown any specified outer delimiters when the input is an empty list.</p>
<pre class=""lang-lisp prettyprint-override""><code>(defun string-delimited (args &amp;key (delim &quot; &quot;) init end show-empty)
  &quot;Takes a list of strings and joins them using the delimiter string.

ARGS must be a list of strings.

DELIM is a string that specifies the delimiter.

INIT is a boolean that indicates whether the delimiter should appear at the
     beginning of the concatenated result. Defaults to NIL.

END is a boolean that indicates whether the delimiter should appear at the
    end of the concatenated result. Defaults to NIL.

SHOW-EMPTY is a boolean that indicates how empty input lists should be
           handled. If this value is true, the delimiters specified by
           INIT and END will appear in the concatenated result even for
           empty input lists. Otherwise the outer delimiters will only
           appear in the result for non-empty input lists.&quot;
  (when (not (or args show-empty))
    (return-from string-delimited &quot;&quot;))
  (let ((result (cdr (loop for s in args
                           collecting delim
                           collecting s))))
    (when init (push delim result))
    (when end (setf (cdr (last result)) (list delim)))
    (reduce (lambda (&amp;optional a b) (concatenate 'string a b)) result)))
</code></pre>
<p>Some example usages:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>CL-USER&gt; (string-delimited '(&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;) :delim &quot;;&quot;)
&quot;a;b;c&quot;

77130744,Using a macro ends in error when using a special variable,77130952,"<p>The macro doesn't evaluate the <code>*delimiter*</code> expression; it works with the source code of that expression which is the <code>*delimiter*</code> symbol itself.</p>
<p>When the argument is <code>&quot;;&quot;</code>, the difference between the two disappears, because <code>&quot;;&quot;</code> is a self-evaluating atom: the source code for <code>&quot;;&quot;</code> and the run-time value of <code>&quot;;&quot;</code> are one and the same.</p>
<p>If your macro takes a parameter which is not going to be inserted into the expansion, but must be evaluated, and that parameter can be any expression (not just literals like <code>&quot;abc&quot;</code>, <code>42</code> or <code>'(1 2 3)</code> (quoted list), you have to use <code>eval</code> on it to get the value.</p>
<p>Let's change your <code>&amp;body</code> to <code>&amp;rest</code> because <code>vars</code> are not a <code>progn</code>-like body.</p>
<p>Let's also change the names of the macro parameters so that they remind us that they are expressions (source code) and not values:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro format-delimited (stream-expr fmt-expr delimiter-expr &amp;rest var-exprs)
  (let ((resulting-fmtstr &quot;&quot;)
        (incoming-fmt (eval fmt-expr))
        (delim (eval delimiter-expr)))
    (dotimes (i (length var-exprs))
      (setf resulting-fmtstr (concatenate 'string resulting-fmtstr incoming-fmt delim)))
    `(format ,stream-expr ,resulting-fmtstr ,@var-exprs)))
</code></pre>
<p>With this I get:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (macroexpand '(format-delimited t &quot;~a&quot; &quot;;&quot; 1 2 3))
(FORMAT T &quot;~a;~a;~a;&quot; 1 2 3) ;
T
&gt; (defvar *delimiter* &quot;---&quot;)
*DELIMITER*
&gt; (macroexpand '(format-delimited t &quot;~a&quot; *delimiter* 1 2 3))
(FORMAT T &quot;~a---~a---~a---&quot; 1 2 3) ;
T
</code></pre>
<p>Needless to say, the <code>eval</code> won't be happening in the apparent lexical environment. That does not exist until run time; at macro-expansion time, we are just processing source code.</p>
<p>The variable being referenced, <code>*delimiter*</code> will  have to exist at macro-expansion time and have the right value.</p>
<p>The <code>format</code> function can do what you're after. The syntax has a lot of bells and whistles. I'm not sure whether it can iterate a format string over multiple arguments, but it can do that with an argument that is a list of values.</p>
<p>You might be concerned that you don't want the format string to be interpreted at run-time.</p>
<p>Common Lisp has a macro called <code>formatter</code> which turns format strings into code (a function).</p>
<p>If you have</p>
<pre><code>(format stream &quot;whatever&quot; args ...)
</code></pre>
<p>you can replace it with</p>
<pre><code>(format stream (formatter &quot;whatever&quot;) args ...)
</code></pre>
<p>to have that string <code>&quot;whatever&quot;</code> compiled. The result is a function (likely a <code>lambda</code> expression). When the second argument of <code>format</code> is a function, it just hands the stream and arguments off to that function.</p>
"
77130744,Using a macro ends in error when using a special variable,77132736,"<p>I see you use <code>str:concat</code>, so you can use <code>(str:join &quot;;&quot; '(&quot;wolf&quot; &quot;golf&quot;))</code> (you don't need a macro).</p>
<p><code>str:join</code> takes two arguments: the delimiter and a list of strings. If you want to write a varying number of strings without a list, like so:</p>
<pre><code>(join-all &quot;;&quot; &quot;wolf&quot; &quot;golf&quot; &quot;rolf&quot; etc etc etc)
</code></pre>
<p>we can write a helper function. It will accept &amp;rest arguments:</p>

<p><code>funcall</code> allows to call a function by name with its right number of arguments. The varying number of strings are grouped as a list thanks to <code>&amp;rest strings</code>, so we can pass this list as argument to <code>str:join</code>.</p>

Realm requires for any update made to its schema to be solved using something called a Migration. This was invented having in considering that when you update your app from an version to another it might have some changes to the database that may make you data inconsistent.
The easiest way the get rid of this is deleting all the current database data if you change your schema add  <code> deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded</code> add configurations as below</p>

55516453,Error: Migration is required due to the following errors in React native (Realm),55520644,"<p>Restrictions on use of non-SDK interfaces</p>

<p>To help ensure app stability and compatiblity, the platform restricts the use of some non-SDK methods and fields; these restrictions apply whether you attempt to access these methods and fields directly, via reflection, or using JNI. In Android 9, your app can continue to access these restricted interfaces; the platform uses toasts and log entries to bring them to your attention. If your app shows such a toast, it is important that you pursue an implementation strategy other than the restricted interface. If you feel that no alternative strategy is feasible, you may file a bug to request reconsideration of the restriction.</p>

<p>Restrictions on Non-SDK Interfaces contains further important information. You should review it to ensure that your app continues to function properly.</p>

<p>Starting in Android 9 (API level 28), the platform restricts which non-SDK interfaces your app can use. These restrictions apply whenever an app references a non-SDK interface or attempts to obtain its handle using reflection or JNI. These restrictions were put in place to help improve the user and developer experience and reduce the risks of crashes for users and emergency rollouts for developers.

<blockquote>
  <p>This is most like due to a previous test using an argument matcher
  against a non-virtual method, or in a Returns statement.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately this can be quite tricky to debug. First step is to see
  if the problem occurs when you run all the test in this fixture. If
  so, check all uses of Arg.Is|Any in that fixture, starting with the
  one that runs immediately before the test that fails (if your test
  framework uses a predictable test order, otherwise you'll need to look
  at test logs to see what tests proceed the failing one).</p>
  
  <p>If it does not occur with that fixture you'll need to look through the
  fixtures that run beforehand to see where the left over arg matcher is
  coming from. It is most likely somewhere near the failing test.</p>

57501932,How to fix run-time error 1004 Method Range of object global failed,57505008,"<p>I don't know what your data looks like, but the outer loop breaks on the second iteration with an empty <code>DataSheet</code>, with the error you describe. That's a good thing, because <code>cells1.Address</code> is <code>$N$2:$N$1048576</code> on an empty sheet... but it doesn't matter, because the first empty cell meets the condition and exits the first inner loop.</p>

<p>But that's merely a symptom, not the real problem.</p>

<p>The second loop is iterating the exact same range as the first loop, but this time none of the empty cells meets the condition, and the loop goes on to iterate every single agonizing row on the worksheet.</p>

<p>And when that loop exits, the <code>count2</code> loop variable reference is <code>Nothing</code> - that's why the 2nd iteration explodes: <code>[_Global|Worksheet].Range</code> accepts several different ways to specify a range of cells, but <code>Nothing</code> is an illegal argument to give it; it raises an error, and execution abruptly stops.</p>

<p>What's happening? The VBA language specifications are relevant here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the <code>&lt;for-each-statement&gt;</code> has finished executing, the value of <code>&lt;bound-variable-expression&gt;</code> is the data value of the last element in <code>&lt;collection&gt;</code>.</p>
  
  <p><sup><sub><a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/microsoft_general_purpose_programming_languages/ms-vbal/b132463a-fd25-4143-8fc7-a443930e0651"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/microsoft_general_purpose_programming_languages/ms-vbal/b132463a-fd25-4143-8fc7-a443930e0651</a></sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems as per specs, both <code>count1</code> and <code>count2</code> should have a valid object reference when the loops exit. However it seems Microsoft's implementation of the VBA language specifications work differently. Here's a minimal repro example:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub Test()
    Dim c As Collection
    Set c = New Collection
    c.Add New Collection 'any object will do
    Dim o As Object
    For Each o In c
        'Exit For
    Next
    Debug.Print o Is Nothing
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Run this code once with <code>Exit For</code> commented-out, then un-comment the statement and run it again. The ""bound variable"" of a <code>For Each</code> loop that is iterating an object collection will be <code>Nothing</code> <strong>if the loop runs to completion</strong>.</p>

<p>That means if the first inner loop ran to completion, you would be having the same error here:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Set Cells2 = Range(Count1, Range(""N2"").End(xlDown))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Because <code>Count1</code> would be <code>Nothing</code> then. On an empty sheet, <code>Count1</code> is pointing to <code>$N$2</code> at this point, so <code>Cells2</code> gets to be <code>$N$2:$N$1048576</code>.</p>

<p><strong>When the second inner loop runs to completion</strong>, <code>Count2</code> is <code>Nothing</code>, and since the loop condition is only looking at <code>Count1</code>...</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> Loop Until Count1 Is Nothing
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>...the second iteration of the outer loop blows up when <code>Count2</code> is passed as an argument to <code>_Global.Range</code>, which fails with error 1004:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Set Cells1 = Range(Count2, Range(""N2"").End(xlDown))

<p>I suppose a band-aid solution could be to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/57502928/1188513"">verify whether <code>Count2 Is Nothing</code> before using it</a>, although that's exactly the same as changing the exit condition to check for both <code>Count1</code> and <code>Count2</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Loop Until Count1 Is Nothing Or Count2 Is Nothing
</code></pre>

<p>...and I don't think that's the right solution. In fact I'm not sure it's <em>a</em> solution.</p>

<p>I can't be 100% sure because I haven't spent too much time trying to work out how <code>Count2</code> not being <code>Nothing</code> affects the outer loop (plus I didn't have any data to toy with), but I think this <em>might</em> just happen to be doing the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>Dim interestingCells As Range
Set interestingCells = DataSheet.Range(""N2:N"" &amp; DataSheet.Rows.Count).End(xlUp)

Dim cell As Range
For Each cell In interestingCells
    If cell.Value &lt; 1 And cell.Offset(3).Value &lt; 1 Then
        cell.Offset(0, 20).Value = cell.Offset(0, -12).Value
    ElseIf cell.Value &gt; 1 And cell.Offset(3).Value &gt; 1 Then
        cell.Offset(0, 21).Value = cell.Offset(0, -12).Value
        cell.Offset(1, 22).Value = cell.Offset(1).Value
    End If
Next
</code></pre>

<p>I honestly think the <em>real</em> solution is to take a step back and re-assess exactly what this loop means to be doing, scrap the old code, and rewrite it from scratch. Anything else would add complexity to an already incredibly hard-to-follow piece of code. Other than the recycled <code>For Each</code> loop variables, the <em>row</em> offsets are particularly confusing: a comment detailing <em>why</em> the next row needs to be affected would be in order - note that such logic probably requires the data to be sorted in a particular way... which might be a bad assumption to make, i.e. a disastrous bug waiting to show its ugly head. Also note that if the iterated range happens to span the entire column, then <code>cell.Offset(n)</code> will fail for any positive value of <code>n</code> when <code>cell</code> is in the very last row, and for any value of <code>n</code> greater than the number of rows left under it if it's <em>near</em> the very last row on the worksheet.</p>

<p>Also note the <code>.End(xlUp)</code> logic to get the last row/cell with data: with that, an empty sheet will not run a single iteration.</p>

<p>Lastly, note the explicitly qualified <code>Range</code> call, so that it resolves to <code>DataSheet.Range</code> rather than <code>_Global.Range</code> - this is one of the very few times I've seen error 1004 thrown by <code>_Global.Range</code> where the root of the issue wasn't the use of unqualified <code>Range</code> calls implicitly referring to whatever the <code>ActiveSheet</code> is.</p>

<p>Please note that I've only ever seen the problem you describe with one document (which contains 2 'invalid' revisions that cause an error 5852 if you query any members of them) and so the code in this answer has only ever been tested on that one document ... I'd normally want to carry out much more testing than that but cannot in this case as I can't create documents with 'invalid' revisions.</p>
<p>The code is commented to explain what it does and how it does it so no lengthy explanation here, other than to say that it searches for the 'last okay' revision by repeatedly splitting the collection of all revisions in the document in two and testing which half contains the 'last okay' and 'first invalid' revisions. Once located, it selects the 'last okay' revision and then moves the selection to the range of the next revision (which is the 'first invalid' revision) and accepts all revisions in that range (which is just the one 'invalid' revision) ... repeats if required (ie if the document contains more than one 'invalid' revision).</p>

<li>This code uses (and moves) the selection (it must use the selection object as the revisions collection is effectively broken) ... calling code may want to store the selection before calling this function and restore it afterwards</li>
<li>This code only tests and fixes invalid revision(s) in the main body of the document (not headers, footers, footnotes etc ... obviously it can be extended to cover those)</li>
<li>This code 'fixes' invalid revisions by accepting them ... change <code>.AcceptAll</code> to <code>.RejectAll</code> if preferred</li>

<p>When using the commented line &quot;If IsObjectValid(r.FormatDescription) Then&quot; Word crashes (no error, no nothing) when opening a particular document. When using &quot;On Error resume next&quot; Word hangs and appears to spend a lot of processor time.</p>
<p>The file was modified by an external user, possibly with Mac Word or some other application.</p>
<p>So it seems that document corruption can cause this error and IsObjectValid or On Error resume next are not workarounds.</p>

<p>Try building and pushing your image from your GitLab CI runner so the architecture of the image will match your runner's architecture.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/desktop/multi-arch/#build-and-run-multi-architecture-images"" rel=""noreferrer"">build for multiple architectures</a> using <code>docker buildx</code> . Alternatively still, you could also run a GitLab runner on ARM architecture so that it can run the image for the architecture you built it on.</p>

<h2>Comment:</h2>
<p>This usually happens when you’re working on projects on a system with ARM architecture, like with the new Apple M-series chipsets. When you push a code to your production environment, which is using an x86 system, it results in the “exec user process caused: exec format error”. This is because every piece of code when converted to the lower level of instructions is different for both ARM and x86. Docker detects the Apple M1 Pro platform as “linux/arm64/v8“.</p>

16246675,Hibernate Error: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session,16246858,"<p>Most probably its because the B objects are not referring to the same Java C object instance. They are referring to the same row in the database (i.e. the same primary key) but they're different copies of it. </p>

<p>So what is happening is that the Hibernate session, which is managing the entities would be keeping track of which Java object corresponds to the row with the same primary key.</p>

<p>One option would be to make sure that the Entities of objects B that refer to the same row are actually referring to the same object instance of C. Alternatively turn off cascading for that member variable. This way when B is persisted C is not. You will have to save C manually separately though. If C is a type/category table, then it probably makes sense to be that way.</p>

<p>I think the technical reason for this would be that the malware registers itself as a wordpress plugin which automatically replaces the file upon deletion. Fortunately the malware is badly written code so instead of running it mostly throws <code>500 error</code>. But in anycase I would recommend to delete it immediately incase it updates.</p>
<p>Edit:
According to the wordpress forum thread on this <a href=""https://wordpress.org/support/topic/critical-error-cplugin-php-file-being-overwritten"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">topic</a>, for some users simply renaming the file also makes the website work, which is probably due to the fact that renaming files in wordpress deactivates the plugin, due to which websites start working. But I would not keep infected files renamed and stored in anycase, so would recommend the 1st solution atleast after gaining access to the site.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dialog
    // A silly workaround to use `inert` until https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/24730 is merged.
    {...{ inert: isInert ? '' : undefined }}
&gt;
    Oh, hi
&lt;/dialog&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>While positively silly, this should short-circuit any specific TypeScript and ESLint complaints and allow you to use it. Note that JSX itself might still complain at you if this is the <em>only</em> attribute on your element, <em>and</em> your element has no children. Why exactly one would create an empty, inert element beats me, but <code>sips tea</code> that's none of my business.</p>
<hr />
<p>A slightly more robust solution would be a combination of a few things.</p>
<p>To make TypeScript happy, you can add (or add to) a <code>declarations.d.ts</code> file for your project, stubbing in a temporary definition for the <code>inert</code> attribute:</p>
<pre><code>declare module 'react' {
  interface HTMLAttributes&lt;T&gt; extends AriaAttributes, DOMAttributes&lt;T&gt; {
    /**
     * Indicates that the browser will ignore this element and its descendants,
     * preventing some interactions and hiding it from assistive technology.
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert
     * @todo Remove this stub declaration after https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/24730 is merged.
     */
    inert?: '';
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you're using ESLint, you can add an exception for <code>inert</code> in your config file (<code>.eslintrc</code> or similar) via <a href=""https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-unknown-property.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the <code>react/no-unknown-property</code> rule</a>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>rules: {
    // Allows the use of the `inert` attribute until https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/24730 is merged.
    'react/no-unknown-property': ['error', { ignore: ['inert'] }],
}
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>In both of these solutions, we're forced to use the slightly odd syntax of passing <code>inert</code> an empty string (for <code>true</code>) or <code>undefined</code> (for <code>false</code>). This feels a bit clunky compared to attributes like <code>disabled</code>, which can directly accept boolean values. Unfortunately, using booleans this way is syntactical sugar that React adds to supported attributes, so we won't get that particular benefit for <code>inert</code> until it's supported natively.</p>

<h2>1. Correct domain on <code>NEXTAUTH_URL</code></h2>
<p>Since <code>https://example.vercel.app</code> is literally an example, instead of setting the <code>NEXTAUTH_URL</code> to it you should set it to <em>your own app domain</em>. You can get your app domain from the <strong>Overview</strong> page in Vercel, under <strong>Domains</strong>. In the following example the app domain would be <code>https://my-simple-app.vercel.app</code>:</p>

</code></pre>
<h2>2. Correct domain on GCP console</h2>
<p>The same should be done in the GCP console, instead of putting <code>https://example.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google</code>, you should put <em>your own app domain</em>, in the case of the example above, that would be <code>https://my-simple-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google</code>:</p>

4670903,Arithmetic overflow error converting numeric to data type numeric,4671198,"<p>My guess is that you're trying to squeeze a number greater than 99999.99 into your decimal fields. Changing it to (8,3) isn't going to do anything if it's greater than 99999.999 - you need to increase the number of digits <em>before</em> the decimal. You can do this by increasing the precision (which is the total number of digits before and after the decimal). You can leave the scale the same unless you need to alter how many decimal places to store. Try <code>decimal(9,2)</code> or <code>decimal(10,2)</code> or whatever.</p>

<p>You can test this by commenting out the <code>insert #temp</code> and see what numbers the select statement is giving you and see if they are bigger than your column can handle.</p>

41636077,Returnsasync(null) throws a build error when using Moq for unit testing in VS15,66245234,"<p>The problem is that the <strong>compiler is choosing which overloaded method to call based on the type of method's parameters and the type of parameters being passed</strong>. It's called <strong>method overload resolution</strong>. But the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/null"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">literal <code>null</code></a> means &quot;<em>without a value</em>&quot; and, at the same time, it doesn't itself carry any type information. And without the type, the compiler doesn't know which overloaded method to call, so it complains that the &quot;<em>call is ambiguous</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>If you would pass the literal <code>&quot;Hello world&quot;</code> instead of <code>null</code>, you (the compiler) know that it has a value (the text &quot;Hello world&quot;) and it's the <code>string</code> type. But in case of <code>null</code>, the type information is missing – it may be a string without a value, a delegate without a value or for example a custom reference type without a value.</p>
<p>As <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/41637268/971141"">Sergey mentioned</a>, there are two overloaded methods:</p>
<pre><code>(this IReturns&lt;TMock, Task&lt;TResult&gt;&gt; mock, TResult value)
(this IReturns&lt;TMock, Task&lt;TResult&gt;&gt; mock, Func&lt;TResult&gt; valueFunction)
</code></pre>
<p>They both have a single parameter, the first one of type <code>TResult</code> and the second one of type <code>Func&lt;TResult&gt;</code>. The <code>null</code> without a type information may be both/any of them, so you just need to hint the compiler which one to call.</p>
<p>You have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>link the <code>null</code> value to some type and call the overload accepting <code>TResult</code></li>
<li>pass a function returning the <code>null</code>, i.e. call the overload accepting <code>Func&lt;TResult&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For me, the easiest solution was to wrap the <code>null</code> into a function, so I didn't have to worry about types anymore. I simply passed an <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions#expression-lambdas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">expression lambda</a> returning <code>null</code> as the parameter, that means I have used the second overloaded method accepting a delegate <code>Func&lt;TResult&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>ReturnAsync(() =&gt; null)
</code></pre>
<p>On the other side, as Sergey mentioned, you can assign the <code>null</code> into a typed variable and pass that:</p>
<pre><code>string x = null;
‪….ReturnAsync(x);
</code></pre>
<p>That way, you have linked the <code>null</code> with a particular type, a string in this case, so again, the compiler will know which overload to use.</p>

<p>This question has more than 30 answers, most suggesting to either downgrade Node.js to pre v17 or to use the legacy SSL provider. Both of those solutions are <em>hacks that leave your builds open to security threats</em>.</p>
<h3>Reason For The Error</h3>
<p>In Node.js v17, the Node.js developers closed a security hole in the SSL provider. This fix was a breaking change that corresponded with similar breaking changes in the SSL packages in NPM. When you attempt to use SSL in Node.js v17 or later without also upgrading those SSL packages in your <code>package.json</code>, then you will see this error.</p>
<h3>The Correct (safe) Solution (for npm users)</h3>
<p>Use an up-to-date version of Node.js, and also use packages that are up-to-date with security fixes.</p>
<p>For many people, the following command will fix the issue:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>npm audit fix --force
</code></pre>
<p>However, be aware that, for complex builds, the above command will pull in breaking security fixes that can <em>potentially</em> break your build.</p>

<p>Yarn users can use <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn-audit-fix"" rel=""noreferrer"">yarn-audit-fix</a> which can be run without installing as a dependency via</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>npm_config_yes=true npx yarn-audit-fix

<p>In your Webpack config, set either of the following:

<p>A. (Webpack v5) Set <code>output.hashFunction = 'xxhash64'</code>.<br />
B. (Webpack v4) This will depend on <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createhash_algorithm_options"" rel=""noreferrer"">what hash algorithms nodejs supports on your system</a>.

24210478,Hibernate: More than one row with the given identifier was found error,32636186,"<p>I got bit by the <code>org.hibernate.HibernateException: More than one row with the given identifier was found:</code> problem and found no help on StackOverflow. It took awhile to sort out the issue so I'm documenting the solution here. I was using JPA/Hibernate and Spring Data.</p>

<p>First off, this was not caused by duplicate rows in the database, as it's obviously not possible to have duplicate primary keys. Instead this was caused by Hibernate looking up an object, and eagerly filling in a One-to-one relationship with a LEFT OUTER JOIN. Hibernate assumed a single row would come back, but two came back because there were two objects associated with the one-to-one relationship.</p>

<p>Here's a simplified version of my objects:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""plate"")
public class Plate {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Id
    @SequenceGenerator(name=""test_seq"", sequenceName=""test_seq"")
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = ""test_seq"")
    @Column(name = ""id"")
    private Long id;

    @Version
    @Column(name = ""object_version"")
    private long objectVersion;

    @Column(name = ""name"")
    private String name;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = ""plate"")
    private Sheet sheet;

    public Sheet getSheet() {
        return sheet;
    }

    public void setSheet(Sheet sheet) {
        if (this.sheet != null) {
            this.sheet.setPlate(null);
        }

        this.sheet = sheet;
        sheet.setPlate(this);
    }
}


@Entity
@Table(name = ""sheet"")
public class Sheet {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Id
    @SequenceGenerator(name=""test_seq"", sequenceName=""test_seq"")
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = ""test_seq"")
    @Column(name = ""id"")
    private Long id;

    @Version
    @Column(name = ""object_version"")
    private long objectVersion;

    @Column(name = ""sheet_name"")
    private String sheetName;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = ""plate_id"")
    private Plate plate;

    public Plate getPlate() {
        return plate;
    }

    // Do not use. Use Plate.setSheet() instead
    void setPlate(Plate plate) {
        this.plate = plate;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is with the @OneToOne relationship between Plate and Sheet. I initially did not want to delete orphan Sheets. In my code I looked up a Plate by id and added a new Sheet. This removed the Plate-to-Sheet relationship from the original Sheet. When I commit the transaction I assumed JPA would save all modified objects (Plate, the original Sheet, and the new Sheet).</p>

<p>This was not true! JPA apparently finds modified objects by walking down the hierarchy from the object that was originally loaded (Plate), and it misses the fact that the original Sheet, which is now orphaned, was modified. This meant the original Sheet's sheet.plate_id column was not cleared in the database. In other words, I broke their relationship in the data model, but it failed to save to the database. So the next time I try to load the plate Hibernate runs a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>select
    plate1_.id as id1_19_12_, 
    plate1_.object_version as object_v2_19_12_, 
    plate1_.name as name3_19_12_, 
    sheet2_.id as id1_39_12_, 
    sheet2_.object_version as object_v2_39_12_, 
    sheet2_.sheet_name as sheet_nam2_39_12_, 
    sheet2_.plate_id as plate_id4_39_12_, 
from 
    plate plate1_
    left outer join sheet sheet2_ on plate1_.id = sheet2_.plate_id
where 
    plate1_.id=?
</code></pre>

<p>Which brings back 2 rows in the result set and produces this error:</p>

<pre><code>org.hibernate.HibernateException: More than one row with the given identifier was found: 10045, for class: com.example.Plate
</code></pre>

<p>This is deceptive: there is only one Plate row with that id in the database, but there are two Sheets linked to it.</p>

<p>The solution:
Seems I have two choices: either cascade all and delete orphan on the one-to-one relationship, or explicitly call my repository class to look up and save the original Sheet every time I remove its relationship with Plate. I opted for the first choice and added this to the plate class:</p>

<pre><code>@OneToOne(mappedBy = ""plate"", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
private Sheet sheet;
</code></pre>

<p>This fixed the issue.</p>

If an app is properly signed with a valid provisioning profile, calling <code>registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:</code> will result in <code>application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:</code> regardless of the user's Notifications choices in the Settings app. From my experience, the only times I have seen <code>application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:</code> get called was because of an improperly signed app. The error in question mentioned ""no valid aps-environment entitlement found for application"".</p>

<p>The answer to main question in the thread is <strong>NO</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:</strong> gets called when the app is signed with incorrect provisioning profile.</p>

<p>Also,</p>

<p><strong>application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:</strong> gets called only when user enables at-least one of the badge, banner/alert or sound setting in the notification center (in Settings app) for your app.</p>

<p>There are scenarios where iOS will not call either of these methods</p>

<ul>
<li>When user refuses to grant permissions for app to send push notifications</li>
<li>When there is no network connectivity and user granted permissions to send push notifications.</li>

</ul>

<p>For debugging purposes, add a command/line to the cron-run script that does:</p>

<pre><code>env &gt; /tmp/cron.job
</code></pre>

<p>Review whether the PATH there includes what you expect, and in particular, whether it includes the directory (directories) where each of the three programs is installed. And do check that you run the programs you expect from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>which vmpstat mpstat iostat
</code></pre>

<p>It is a reasonable guess that the two 'missing' commands are not in a directory on PATH when your script is run by <code>cron</code>. And <code>cron</code> gives you a bare minimal environment; it is completely unlike <code>at</code> in that respect.</p>

<p>Ok, I suspect the issue here for many people is that the GitLab session cookie is set to Secure here: <a href=""https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/9c491bc628f5a72424b82bb01e2457150bf2e71c/config/initializers/session_store.rb#L25"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/9c491bc628f5a72424b82bb01e2457150bf2e71c/config/initializers/session_store.rb#L25</a></p>
<p>Setting the right SSL headers fixes the problem.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, the connection doesn't appear to be an HTTPS connection, Rails won't send a cookie, and the client won't be able to login. You may be able to confirm this by checking the response headers in the <code>GET /users/sign_in</code> endpoint: if you see a <code>_gitlab_session</code> cookie being sent the first time you load the page, then things are working properly.</p>

385975,Error handling in C code,387123,"<p>I've used both approaches, and they both worked fine for me.  Whichever one I use, I always try to apply this principle:</p>

<p><em>If the only possible errors are programmer errors, don't return an error code, use asserts inside the function.</em></p>

<p>An assertion that validates the inputs clearly communicates what the function expects,  while too much error checking can obscure the program logic.  Deciding what to do for all the various error cases can really complicate the design.  Why figure out how functionX should handle a null pointer if you can instead insist that the programmer never pass one?</p>
"
385975,Error handling in C code,386001,"<p>I like the error as return-value way. If you're designing the api and you want to make use of your library as painless as possible think about these additions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>store all possible error-states in one typedef'ed enum and use it in your lib. Don't just return ints or even worse, mix ints or different enumerations with return-codes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>provide a function that converts errors into something human readable. Can be simple. Just error-enum in, const char* out.</p>

<li><p>I know this idea makes multithreaded use a bit difficult, but it would be nice if application programmer can set an global error-callback. That way they will be able to put a breakpoint into the callback during bug-hunt sessions.</p>

One of the best slides is this decision tree:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8wQq.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8wQq.png"" alt=""Error Handling Decision Tree""></a></p>

<p>I would personally change two things about this flowcart.</p>

<p>First, I would clarify that sometimes objects should use return values to indicate errors. If a function only extracts data from an object but doesn't mutate the object, then the integrity of the object itself is not at risk and indicating errors using a return value is more appropriate.</p>

<p>Second, it's not <em>always</em> appropriate to use exceptions in C++. Exceptions are good because they can reduce the amount of source code devoted to error handling, they mostly don't affect function signatures, and they're very flexible in what data they can pass up the callstack. On the other hand, exceptions might not be the right choice for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>C++ exceptions have very particular semantics. If you don't want those semantics, then C++ exceptions are a bad choice. An exception must be dealt with immediately after being thrown and the design favors the case where an error will need to unwind the callstack a few levels.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ functions that throw exceptions can't later be wrapped to not throw exceptions, at least not without paying the full cost of exceptions anyway. Functions that return error codes can be wrapped to throw C++ exceptions, making them more flexible. C++'s <code>new</code> gets this right by providing a non-throwing variant.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ exceptions are relatively expensive but this downside is mostly overblown for programs making sensible use of exceptions. A program simply shouldn't throw exceptions on a codepath where performance is a concern. It doesn't really matter how fast your program can report an error and exit.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes C++ exceptions are not available. Either they're literally not available in one's C++ implementation, or one's code guidelines ban them.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Since the original question was about a multithreaded context, I think the local error indicator technique (what's described in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/393701/sirdarius"">SirDarius</a>'s <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/14551626/"">answer</a>) was underappreciated in the original answers. It's threadsafe, doesn't force the error to be immediately dealt with by the caller, and can bundle arbitrary data describing the error. The downside is that it must be held by an object (or I suppose somehow associated externally) and is arguably easier to ignore than a return code.</p>

46735483,error: Do not use Array index in keys,46735689,"<p>When you use index of an array as a key, React will optimize and not render as expected. What happens in such a scenario can be explained with an example.</p>

<p>Suppose the parent component gets an array of 10 items and renders 10 components based on the array. Suppose the 5th item is then removed from the array. On the next render the parent will receive an array of 9 items and so React will render 9 components. This will show up as the 10th component getting removed, instead of the 5th, because React has no way of differentiating between the items based on index. </p>

<p>Therefore always use a unique identifier as a key for components that are rendered from an array of items.</p>

<p>You can generate your own unique key by using any of the field of the child object that is unique as a key. Normal, any id field of the child object can be used if available.</p>

<p>Edit : You will only be able to see the behavior mentioned above happen if the components create and manage their own state, e.g. in uncontrolled textboxes, timers etc. E.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46477711/react-error-when-removing-input-component"">React error when removing input component</a></p>

<p>Here is my example that I came across while building a list with input tags. One list is rendered based on index, another one based on id.

<p>Reordering a list, or adding and removing items from a list can cause issues with the component state, when indexes are used as keys. If the key is an index, reordering an item changes it. Hence, the component state can get mixed up and may use the old key for a different component instance.</p>
<p>What are some exceptions where it is safe to use index as key?</p>
<ul>
<li>If your list is static and will not change.</li>
<li>The list will never be re-ordered.</li>

<p>So to add access to other <em>aws</em> users, first
you must edit ConfigMap to add an IAM user or role to an Amazon EKS cluster.</p>
<p>You can edit the ConfigMap file by executing:

<p>As the amazon documentation(<a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">iam-docs</a>) states you need to create a role binding on the kubernetes cluster for the user specified in the ConfigMap.

<p><code>kubectl create clusterrolebinding ops-user-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=ops-user</code></p>

<p>When we create the EKS cluster by any method via CloudFormation/CLI/EKSCTL the IAM role/user who created the cluster will automatically binded to the default kubernetes RBAC API group <code>system:masters</code> (<a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles</a>) and in this way creator of the cluster will get the admin access to the cluster. Although we can always give the access to other IAM user/role using the aws-auth file but for that we must have to use the IAM user/role who created the cluster.</p>
<p>To verify the role/user for the EKS cluster we can search for the <code>CreateCluster&quot;</code> Api call on cloudtrail and it will tell us the creator of the cluster in the <code>sessionIssuer</code> section for field <code>arn</code> (<a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html</a>).</p>

<h2>Scenario-2: Cluster was Created using the IAM Role (For example &quot;eks-role&quot;)</h2>
<hr />
<p>Mainly there are four different way to setup the access via cli when cluster was created via IAM role.</p>
<p><strong>1. Setting up the role directly in kubeconfig file.</strong></p>
<p>In this case we do not have to make any assume role api call via cli manually, before running kubectl command because that will be automatically done by <code>aws/aws-iam-authenticator</code> set in the kube config file.</p>
<p>Lets say now we are trying to setup the access for the user <code>eks-user</code> the first make sure that user does have permission to assume the role <code>eks-role</code></p>
<p>Add the assume role permission to the <code>eks-user</code></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>I have try to cover major use case here but there might be other use case too where we need to setup the access to the cluster.</p>
<p>Also the above tests are mainly aiming at the first time setup of the EKS cluster and none of the above method is touching the aws-auth configmap yet.
But once you have given access to other IAM user/role to EKS cluster via aws-auth (<a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html</a>) file you can use the same set of commands for those users too as mentioned in above answer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em> If you are using the <em><strong>SSO</strong></em> then setup will be preety much same but one thing we have to consider is either in case of SSO or while using the role directly if we are trying to update path based role in ConfigMap then we have to get rid of the paths in role for example instead <code>arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxx:role/path-1/subpath-1/eks-role</code> of this use <code>arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxx:role/eks-role</code> so basically we are getting rid of the <code>/path-1/subpath-1</code> becuase when we run kubectl command it will first make <code>AssumeRole</code> api call and if we see assumed role ARN then it will not contians the path so if we include the path then it EKS will deny those requests.</p>

<ul>
<li>your project directory has <code>&amp;</code> symbol in the name, this happens because when node encounters &amp; symbols it breaks the string into 2, ( if you have worked with simple http authentication, you would know this issue )</li>
<li>delete you <code>node_modules</code>, <code>package.lock.json</code>, install both again and run start script - suitable for linux systems only,</li>

<p>Thus, please run both commands from the ""windows"" folder:</p>

<p>First, launch zookeeper:</p>

<pre><code>C:\DevTools\kafka_2.12-2.4.1\bin\windows&gt;zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\..\config\zookeeper.properties

<p>Important to mention that if you would use git bash on a windows machine to launch zookeeper and the kafka server you may face some errors regarding to the construction of the $CLASSPATH in ""kafka-run-class"":</p>
